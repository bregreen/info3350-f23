Before the Orders of the Day are called, I wish to bring

to the attention of the Prime Minister and the Minister of Marine and Fisheries, who,
1 regret, is not in his place, a matter which affects large interests in Canada. This letter was placed in my hands yesterday by the proprietor of a large summer hotel at Oananoque. It is dated Rochester, N.Y., May 31st, 1904, and is as follows :


Day,
Gananoque, Ont.
Dear sir,-Your favour of the 27th, and also the booklets received. We surely will do all we can to send our people your way, but we want to say right here, unless you make a move immediately to disabuse the notion that has got abroad here in the city that your fish laws have been changed so as to make them very restrictive, that a number of people who contemplated going over into Canada and spending their vacation, and leaving lots of their money, are. contemplating going in other directions. It is unfortunate that such a notion got started, for it will be difficult to overtake it. We would suggest that if you can have it denied authoritatively in some of your local papers, and send us copies so that we can have it copied in our papers, it would he the most effective way.
You will do us a great favour if you will keep us advised of the transfer boats from Gananoque-the hour they leave Gananoque for other points and when they return. Send us some time table, if you can.
With kind regards, we remain Very truly yours,
P. J. AMSDEN & SON.
I have also a clipping from the Rochester ' Post,' of Thursday, June 2, and the information contained in this item seems to be official. The item is as follows :


Canadian Authorities Demand Everything but the Pleasure.
Nothing said as yet about Seizing Piscatorial Photographs and American Fishermen are still permitted to bring home their rods. Information of importance to Americans intending to visit Canada this year to enjoy the fishing is contained in the following communication from S. T. Bastedo, deputy commissioner of fisheries, Canada, sent to Frank J. Amsden, of this city ' We are having regulations prepared, and, among other things, perhaps the one that will interest you most is that a number of bass this year which any one will be allowed to take shall not exceed eight, and ten inches is the minimum size. I do not think there would be any charge at the customs office where you are carrying your rods with you, but no fish may be taken home. We allow you to come here and enjoy our fishing and charge you nothing for it ; but in former years where a certain amount of the catch has been allowed to be sent out of the country, this privilege has been abused. Parties have sent fish away by the barrel-in fact, we are informed, made a business of this in order to defray their expenses while here. Of course, there is only a certain class of fishermen who would do this thing, but 1381
the abuses have led to the privilege being denied to all.
iSome years ago an) arrangement was made between the American authorities and the Canadian government that certain districts west to Kingston and east as far as Ogdensburg, covering what is known as the Thousand Islands resort, should be a free international park, that the American Alien Labour Law would not be enforced so far as it applied to this district, and that Americans could fish there in Canadian waters and Canadians could come and go as they pleased. That has been acted upon for years. The Americans were to put up a certain number of pavilions and docks and make common pleasure resorts on their side if the Canadian government would do the same.
The improvements were carried out on the Canadian side, but the Americans have not carried out their part of the arrangement. This Mr. Bastedo is the assistant commissioner for the province of Ontario, he writes this as an official letter, and the result will be to prevent thousands and thousands of Americans from visiting the Canadian waters of the St. Lawrence this year because they are given to understand that if they come here to fish they cannot take the fish out of Canada. I do not know what arrangement exists between this government and the Ontario government in reference to fishing in Lake Ontario and the River St. Lftwrence, whether this government has jurisdiction or not; but I think when Mr. Bastedo sent out a document of that kind stating that Americans can come here and fish, but cannot take any fish home, he should have been sure of his ground. Of course we know that fishermen do not take any fish home, except perhaps when a gentleman takes a large fish which he may desire to express to his friends in New York, or take it to his hotel on the American side, as Canadians do who catch fish on the American side. I think the government should make an official announcement upon this matter so that the Americans may be notified that they can come and fish and spend. their money in Canada, and if they choose to take half a dozen fish, they are at liberty to do so. I hope the Prime Minister will discuss this matter with the Minister of Marine and Fisheries and let this pronouncement go forth to contradict the statement that has been published broadcast in all the papers of the United States to the great inj'ury of Canada.
Before the Orders of the Day are called, I would like to renew my question to the Prime Minister with reference to the printing of the voters' list.


With reference to this subject to which my hon. friend (Mr. Wilson) has more than once called my attention, some few days ago I wrote down to the King's Printer, and this is the information which was sent to me :
Since you last reported to the House upon the state of the printing of the voters' list we have been going on with the maritime province lists. Out of thirteen New Brunswick constituencies, twelve are done, and out of 17 Nova Scotia constituencies eight are done. No more of Quebec or Ontario have been done since your statement in ' Hansard.' The maritime province lists will all be done shortly, for they are nearly all in hand. Then I propose (if I get no orders to the contrary) to take up such of the Ontario lists first as will be valid for the longest time. Quebec province is half done as it is, and I propose to bring up Ontario to the same position and then go on ' pari passu.' The lists are taken up as the current work permits. The inclosed extract from my last report (which has been presented to the House) gives a good idea of the 1 state of the business.


The New Brunswick list has been printed twice since I have had one for Lennox. When I spoke before I had a New Brunswick list before me for 1904. I do not think this is fair treatment as I have not had any list since 1900.


I would ask the right hon. gentleman whether he has any answer to-day to the question I have submitted to him three or four times with regard to the constitution of the commission appointed to inquire with respect to alien labour. The right hon. gentleman has always said he would answer on some other day. I would like to know whether counsel had been appointed, and what was the mode of procedure before the commission.


Mr. H. M. Mowat, ICC., of Toronto, has been appointed counsel.


Was he appointed at first ?
Sir WILLIAM MULOCK No. He is in Winnipeg with Judge Winchester at the present time.


['Mr. Speaker, I believe the House was occupied to a rather late hour last night, and after listening to two such speeches as we have had to-day, they will be disposed to thank', 'me for moving the adjournment of the debate. I therefore move that the debate be novr adjourned.']
That the House go into committee to consider of the ways and means for raising the supply to be granted to His Majesty.
He said :	Mr. Speaker, in presenting my
eighth budget. I rejoice that I am in a position to congratulate the House upon the continuance, in a very large degree, of that prosperity which Canada has enjoyed for ' Mr. WILSON.
a long time. Some recent conditions have-not been so favourable as some might desire. The severity of the winter, the unusually heavy snowfall in central Canada, the lateness of the opening of navigation-on our inland waters-all these things ha veto some extent operated to disturb our ordinary business conditions ; but any disturbance of that kind will of course only be temporary. Far from complaining of the influence of winter, we should recognize the fact that we have compensation in other directions, for the steady cold season lends itself to that great lumbering-industry which is so important to Canada. .Tack Frost continues to be one of our best friends, and the Canadian winter one of Canada's most valuable assets.
There is some anxiety in the industrial world, among our manufacturers not because of any conditions which exist in Canada, but rather because of conditions-which it is feared do exist, or are likely te exist, in other countries, and particularly in the great republic to the south. There is an opinion in the minds of our manufacturing people that the signs of depression which have already appeared across the border will continue, and that there may be a period of severe depression in that country the effects of which would be bound to cross the border in the shape of an increased and perhaps an illegitimate competition. We are not at liberty to ignore considerations of that kind, in the fixing of our own fiscal policy we are bound to take note of these things. Nor should we fail to point the moral of a depression that prevails in the most highly protected country in the world. There is a tendency in the minds of many who are strong advocates of a high tariff policy to believe that such a policy is the best guarantee of prosperity. Yet we have the remarkable fact to-day that our manufacturers in Canada are chiefly alarmed lest there should be a great depression in the very country where depression ought to be impossible, if high tariffs are a guarantee of prosperity. Indeed I think it would not be a mistake to say that as between the two countries today, the condition of business is better in Canada with a moderate tariff than it is in the neighbouring republic where they have the highest tariff known throughout the world.
There is much in the outlook to-day which calls for serious consideration, for careful thought and for careful action, on the part of men both in public and private life.. But while there is need for thought and for caution, there is no need for discouragement. The business conditions of Canada generally, I believe to be sound, and our crop prospects are all that could be desired. There is no reason why we should not look forward with hope and confidence to a continuance of that great and growing prosperity for

*which Canada has been so noted during the past few years.
Our last session of parliament was so protracted that before the close we were able to have presented to the House the outlines of the condition of the finances of the Dominion for the year which had then recently closed, and since then the public accounts have been laid on the table, so that only a passing allusion is needed to the finances of the year which ended on the 30th June, 1903. My estimate for the revenue of that year was $05,000,000. The actual revenue was $66,037,068.93, an increase of revenue beyond my estimate of $1,037,068.93. The estimate of the expenditure proved to be a very close one. The estimate was $51,650,000. The actual expenditure of the year was $51,691,902.76, being an increase of expenditure over the amount which I ventured to speak of in my anticipations in the last budget to the extent of $41,902.76. I estimated that we would probably have on the operations of the year a surplus of $13,350,000. The out-turn of the year gave us a sur-l>lus of $14,345,166.17. The surplus thus was nearly $1,000,000 more than the sum at which I placed it in the last budget speech. That surplus was the largest in the history of Canada. The revenue increased over 1902 by $7,986,287.90, while the expenditure increased by $932,510.79. Too often it happens in relation to the affairs of government and of public bodies charged with the administration of affairs that where you are blessed with an increase of revenue you also have a corresponding increase of expenditure, but we are happily able to point out that this is not the experience of this government in recent years, for in the figures which I have presented to you I have shown you that while in the year 1903 we increased our revenue by nearly $8,000,000, we only increased our expenditure on consolidated fund account by $932,510,79 :

character in the postage to Great Britain. Notwithstanding all that, we find that at a time when we might reasonably look for a deficit, at a time when, if my hon. friend the Postmaster General had come before parliament and admitted that he had a deficit of a large amount he would still have had a splendid record in comparison with the record of his predecessors, but we have a different condition from that, and my hon. friend the Postmaster General is in a position to point out that while granting these reductions, he is able to have a larger revenue than ever before, and not only a larger revenue, but to wipe out his deficits and to convert them into surpluses. The deficit in the year 1896, as stated in the public accounts, was $700,997. There was an inquiry afterwards by a commissioner which resulted in some re-adjustment of the accounts, and I think that in the post office accounts, the figures differed a little from the figures in the accounts of the Finance Department, but, figuring one year with another, the statement will be found to be correct, and so I take the figures which are found in the accounts in the Finance Department. In 1S96, as I have said, there was a deficit of $700,997. There were also accumulations of deficits not provided for which had to be dealt with by a special vote, and which are not referred to here. In 1897, the deficit was reduced from $700,997 to $586,539.


That was by a special vote ?


The special vote simply dealt with these accumulations.


That special vote provided for that deficit.


No, my hon. friend (Mr. Sproule) is wrong ; the special vote simply wiped out the accumulations of deficits which had accumulated in previous years. The accounts of the Post Office Department showed from year to year certain deficits, and these are the figures that I have quoted; but over and above that there were found these accumulations of arrearages, debts due by the post office which had not been dealt with, and my hon. friend the Postmaster General took a special vote to wipe these out and start afresh.


That is what I say.


That special vote was for the payment of past deficits and it had nothing whatever to do with the later deficit to which I refer.


That special vote provided for the deficit up to that date.





It was not the deficit that I am speaking of, but the deficits prior to 1896, the deficits that my hon. friend the Postmaster General had nothing to do with except to provide for them and wipe them out.


I say that is what he did.


The following statement will show the operations of the Post Office Department for several years :

In 1899 there was a deficit of $410,021 that was the year when the reduction of postage took place.
As my hon. friend the Postmaster General has pointed out, if you compare service with service and omit the items for the Yukon and Atlin districts, there was in the year 1902 an actual surplus ; but I am taking the figures as they appear in the public accounts, and the total expenditure, including the Atlin and Yukon showed a deficit in 1902 of $105,221. In 1903, not taking into-account service for service ; making no comparisons as respects the degree or service rendered at one time or another-though we know that these comparisons show very favourably to the present Postmaster General-but simply taking the results as we find them in the public accounts ; in the year 1903, instead of having a deficit of $700,000 as we had in 1896 with the three cent rate ; in 1903 we have a two cent rate (involving as Sir Charles Tupper said a gift of $1,000,000 to the people) and besides that we have a clear surplus in the Post Office Department of $292,000.
It will be found convenient for comparison to have a statement side by side for the two years as to all classes of expenditure, and therefore I present the following statement.﻿4337

In the year 1902, our expenditures of all kinds amounted to $63,970,799, and in the year 1903 our expenditures of all kinds were $61,746,371. The House may be surprised to learn that at a time when we might naturally look for an increase of expenditure, the gross expenditure for all kinds for the year 1903 was less by $2,224,228, than it was in the preceding year.
With regard to the fiscal year which will end on the 30th of June next, the year has so far advanced now that we are in a position to make a fairly close estimate as to what the actual outcome will be.
May I ask whether the statement is correct that you credit the income from Dominion lands to revenue and charge the expenditure to capital ?


There is no change in the method of dealing with that item. I am not sure but perhaps there is some room to debate as to whether those two items are dealt with properly, but however that may be, they" have never materially altered the
situation and no change whatever has been made by us in the method of dealing with them.


That is the fact ?


Well, certain portions of the expenditure in connection with Dominion lands arising out of the opening up of the Northwest and the development of the country are charged to capital account. That practice has been continued, although the receipts from the Dominion lands go into the general fund. There is possibly room for fair criticism as to the method employed in former years and at the present time :n respect to that account, but it does not materially alter the general result which I am presenting.
I am glad to find that the revenue for the current year, of which the greater part has now expired, has continued very buoyant. The following table will show the revenue for the eleven months of this current year as compared with the eleven months of last year.

Net increase				4,992,733 99	
It will be noticed that there has been a gratifying increase in customs, excise, and post office ; while there is a small decrease in miscellaneous revenues. There is on the whole a net increase of $4,992,733.99 in the general revenues up to date. There is a small increase of something over $20,000,000 from railways, but I am afraid when the time comes to present the statement of expenditure, it will be found that the showing is not so favourable, because the severity of the winter made all railway operation expensive, and in connection with the Intercolonial Railway there has been a very large increase of pay to the working men all over the line which will of course affect the statement for the current year. While the railway revenue shows some increase there will not be as gratifying a statement as we might desire bn for the operation of the year. Our total revenue up to the 31st of May is as follows :
Revenue.

Or, say in round numbers.. ..$71,000,000 00
In reaching this estimate of $71,000,000, I am taking the receipts to date and for the balance of the year I am not allowing for any increase. There has been perhaps some little check in business owing to the causes I have mentioned, and I am not going to assume that for the balance of the year we will have an increase of revenue, although I am hopeful we may. I am assuming we will hold our own, and therefore on the basis of the receipts to May 31. and the continuance of the revenue for the remainder of the year to correspond with that for the Mr. FIELDING.
same period of last year, I estimate that we shall have a revenue of $71,000,000. The total expenditure chargeable to consolidated fund to May 31, 1904, was $41,623,560.67. My estimate for the balance of the year is that in closing up the accounts we shall probably expend about as much as we did a year ago, namely, $12,731,931.12. This will bring the total expenditure chargeable to consolidated fund to $54,355,491.79 ; or say in round numbers $54,500,000.
I anticipate, then, that for the current year we shall have a revenue of $71,000,000 and an expenditure chargeable to consolidated fund of $54,500,000, leaving us the magnificent surplus of $16,500,000.
On capital account I estimate that we shall spend during the current year $11,-
500,000.	If, then, we take into account the expenditure on consolidated fund, the expenditure on capital account, the surplus, the sums which we shall set aside as sinking funds, and which merely pass from one hand to the other and go to swell our assets, the result will be, I anticipate, that at the close of the current year we shall have reduced the net debt of Canada to the extent of $7,500,000.
It has been my happy privilege to present from time to time statements of prosperous years in which we have had many surpluses ; and I have thought that it would be well to summarize the surplus account during the eight years that this government has administered the public affairs of the country. In the year 1896-7, the first year that this government was in power-a year during which we had not full control of affairs, because we had taken largely the estimates of our predecessors-there was a deficit of $519,981.44. That was the last deficit, the end of deficits so far as we had anything to do with them. We find, then, the statement for the eight years to be as follows :

It was the good fortune of our predecessors in the eighteen years during which they managed the affairs of the country to have some surpluses and some deficits. Taking them together and striking the average, we find that during the eighteen years of their administration they had an average surplus of $544,539.61. while during our eight years we have had an average surplus of $7,235,011.49.
The question of the public debt is always an important one. In a country like Canada, a comparatively new and young country, it would not be surprising if we had to show large increases of the public debt. I have on several occasions, in referring to decreases which we have been able to show, pointed out that no finance minister in a country like Canada need be ashamed if he has to come before parliament and acknowledge that he is increasing the public debt. That ought to be the normal condition in a young country like ours, with vast resources to develop, with improvements all around us waiting to be done, and with courageous men ready to do them ; but happily we are relieved from any such necessity. The following shows the net debt of the Dominion, beginning with the year 1896, and continuing down to the present date :

Thus we shall have this happy statement to present to the public, that we have carried on the public affairs of this Dominion for a period of eight years, during which we have engaged in large ventures and great improvements ; we have spent money liberally, our hon. friends opposite sometimes say lavishly ; we have generously provided for all demands for the public improvement of the country ; and we shall be able at the close of the eight years to say that we have not added one dollar to the debt of Canada. On the contrary, from these figures we shall probably be able to show that there has been a reduction in the net debt during the eight years of $1,084,993.66, or an average yearly reduction in our eight years of $135,624.20, against an average yearly increase in the net debt in the preceding eighteen years of $6,563,075.
In these statements respecting the public debt, I am confining myself entirely to the actual operations of the government, and the affairs with which we have had ourselves to do-those for which we are responsible and for which we may take credit, if credit there be, or blame, if the reverse be the case. There is however an item in relation to the public debt which I have ignored here. It will be remembered that at an early stage of the session a question arose as to the relation of the adjustment of the accounts of the provinces with the Dominion to the public debt, and I asked the House to suspend judgment on that point, because I had formed the impression that the method of treating that account in its relation to the public debt was not correct. After fuller inquiry, I am satisfied that an erroneous view was taken as to the effect of that settlement on the public debt. I do not wish to enter fully into that matter to-day. Later, however, I shall bring down a memorandum
from the officers of my department showing the position of the accounts. The question however arises, I may say, out of the appropriations made in 1884 by the parliament of Canada as allowances to the various provinces. Certain sums were set apart to the credit of each province, and while, as respects most of the provinces, these sums were immediately carried into the debt of the Dominion, in the cases of Ontario and Quebec they were dealt with ih another form. They were not entered up as part of the debt hut treated in another way to- produce the same result, but I think it would have been more correct, as a matter of book-keeping, to have dealt with them as we did in the case of the other provinces. There has been from time to time discussion as to whether these sums constituted a capital sum of money belonging to each of these provinces, or whether they simply created an annuity. I have always considered that these sums were capital placed to the credit of the province of Ontario and Quebec, properly chargeable to the Dominion, and so long as they remain in the hands of the Dominion, of course they yield revenue to these provinces. It appears however that in the making up of the recent statement of affairs as between the Dominion and these provinces of Ontario and Quebec, the idea that these sums created an annuity ran into the minds of the officials. While they took into account the annuity or annual interest, they ignored the principal sum, and I am satisfied now that in a proper statement of the accounts, the best way would be to charge up that sum against the debt of the Dominion and credit whatever there is on the other side. However, I do not propose to dwell on that feature, but simply call attention to the erroneous view taken by the officials of the Finance Department, for which of course I am responsible, and by the Auditor General when these accounts were prepared.
Is this the matter which was discussed somewhat earlier in the session, about two months ago, and is the statement to which the right hon. gentleman refers the one he then promised to bring down ?


My deputy was absent in England and I stated that on his return I would have him investigate the matter and prepare a memorandum. He is doing so, and I will submit it to the House, though not perhaps-in connection with the Budget, but I refer to it to show why I claim credit for less dimunition in the public debt last year than the public accounts show. In that respect the public Mr. FIELDING.
accounts were in error, but the matter will be made right in the accounts of the present year.


Perhaps the hon. gentleman will see that it is brought down as soon as convenient. Two months have elapsed since the promise was made.


I have stated the substance more fully than I intended when I began. I am giving an explanation now almost as full as the one my deputy will be able to give in any memorandum he can make.


The matter, as it has been treated, would seem to decrease the public debt. As it is to be treated, will it have the effect of increasing the public debt ?


A certain sum, about $3,000,000, was found by the adjustment of accounts, to be payable by the provinces to the Dominion and was placed to the credit of the Dominion. The other item should have appeared on the other side of ,tha accounts, but assuming it was an annuity, it was not treated as a principal sum. It will not materially disturb the figures 1 have given. I am confining my remarks to-day entirely to the operations of this government without reference to that item, which is a book-keeping entry relating to affairs of bygone years. In the statement we submitted we have drawn the line clearly between the reduction of debt brought about by our own operations and that which was assumed to be brought about through the operation of these accounts, so that the public accounts, while not strictly correct, in the matter, are correct in this respect, that we have drawn the line distinctly between the operations of this government and what is the result of a mere bookkeeping entry. Whatever the result may be, it will have to be carried into the public accounts of the present year. The statement I have made deal with the income and expenditure of the government for the whole period of eight years and the result will be as I have said.
It will be interesting to have a statement showing how our interest account stands in view of this change in relation to the public debt. The manner of computing the interest on the public debt is by taking the gross receipts from our sinking fund and other investments. In 1896 the gross interest on our debt amounted to $10,502,429.90. Deducting from this the interest on sinking funds and other investments, amounting to $1,-
370,000.56, left a net amount of interest of $9,134,429.34. Following the figures down we find the following result :

Interest paid on Debt.	Interest on Sinking Funds and other Investments	Net amount of Interest.1897	10,645,663 27 10,516,757 90 10,855,111 84 10,099,645 20 10,807,954 65 10,975,935 15 11,068,139 17	1,443,003 84 1,513,654 58 1,590,447 91 1,683,050 51 1,784,833 79 1,892,224 09 2,020,953 04	9,202,659 43 9,003,103 32 9,264,663 93 9,016,594 69 9,023,120 86 9,083,711 06 9,047,186 131898	
1899	1900	1901	
1902	1903	
So that our net interest account for the year 1903 was $9,047,186.13 against $9,132,429.34 in 1896. Equally agreeable is a statement of the net debt per head.
Any statement of the general debt fails perhaps to convey a very adequate meaning to the mind unless we see what relation it bears to the ability of the country to pay it. As the country increases in population, we might have a considerable increase in debt without any increase in the burden, because the rate per head would not be advanced. The statement I am about to present differs a little from one of the same character which I presented on a former occasion, because the dates chosen are not the same I thought it well to have a statement showing the population on the same date as the debt is fixed, that is the 30th of June in each case. The census date was April. Take census figures for April and apply them to the debt of June 30 and you will lack some of the accuracy which is desirable. I have therefore had the statement of population made up in the Census Department as on the 30th of June of each year and of course the net debt statement is the 30th of June each year. The result is this, beginning with the year 1891 :

We are so near the end of the year 1904, that we can make the estimate closely, and we anticipate that on June 30, 1904, the net debt of Canada will stand at $46.31 as stated in the above table, as against $50.61 on the 30th June, 1896.
My hon. friend the Minister of Customs (Mr. Paterson) thinks that I have hardly been liberal enough in estimating the population of Canada to-day ; I have taken the figures as they have been furnished by the Census Department, thinking that was the best way.
During the past year we have had some loan operations, the nature of which should be stated to the House although they have been in part already communicated to the House.	'
I would like to ask my hon. friend whether in his statement of interest on the public debt he takes into consideration temporary arrangements of overdue loans.

These figures, which will be found in very much more detail in the diagrams which will be distributed, give very gratifying evidence of the great increase in trade and wealth which has taken place in Canada and of which hon. members on 'both sides of the House are, I am sure, equally proud. While the condition of the country generally has been good, we have reason to be particularly grateful for the splendid prosperity which has come to the great Northwest. All portions of our Dominion have equal demands upon us, and all portions are, I trust, receiving from the government and parliament their fair share of consideration ; but all portions have not equal inducements to offer to the immigrants who are seeking for homes. The vast territories of the Northwest offer inducements to the land hungry such as the eastern provinces cannot be expected to hold out, and naturally the efforts of my hon. friend the Minister of the Interior (Mr. Sifton) and the officers of his department are chiefly turned to the important duty of filling up the vacant lands of the Northwest. 4I wonder if we are able to appreciate the vast extent of land still available in these Territories. Canada is a country of such magnificent distances that sometimes it is difficult for us to understand and appreciate the vastness of that territory.
Dr. Wm. Saunders, of the Experimental Farm, in an admirable article in the April number of the ' Canadian Magazine,' has discussed the question of wheat-growing in Canada, and he has given some estimate of the available land in the Northwest Territories for that branch of farming. The figures that he gives are as follows :
Acres.
Manitoba	 27,000,000
Assiniboia	 50,000,000
Saskatchewan	 52,000,000
Alberta	 42,000,000
Total	171,000,000
It is thus estimated-
Says Dr. Saunders,
-that there are within the limits referred to, after making allowance for lands unfit for agriculture, about 171,000,000 acres suitable for cultivation, by which is meant land of such degree of fertility as to admit of profitable farming.
Further on Dr. Saunders deals with the question of the ability of Canada to supply food for the mother country, and the statement he makes on that question-perhaps hon. gentlemen have had their attention already drawn to it-is well worthy of being-repeated. It is headed in the publication I have mentioned, ' A Reasonable Prophecy ' :
The total imports of wheat and flour into Great Britain in 1902 were equivalent in all to about 200,000,000 bushels of wheat. Were one-fourth of the land said to be suitable for cultivation in Manitoba and the three provisional

territories under crop with wheat annually, and the average production equal to that of Manitoba for the past ten years, the total crop would be over 812,000,000 bushels. This would be ample to supply the home demand for 30,000,000 of inhabitants (supposing the population of Canada should by that time reach that figure) and meet the present re-uirements of Great Britain three times over. This estimate deals only with a portion of the west, and it leaves the large eastern provinces out of consideration altogether. Prom this it would seem to be quite possible that Canada may be in a position within comparatively few years, after supplying all home demands, to furnish Great Britain with all the wheat and flour she requires and leave a. surplus for export to other countries. With a rural population on the western plains in 1902 of about 400,000, over 67,000,000 bushels of wheat were produced. Add to this the wheat grown in Ontario and the other eastern provinces and we already have a total of over 93,000,000 bushels. These figures are full of promise for the future of Canada as a great wheat-producing country.
It is natural to conclude that, with such-i territory to offer to the people, all that is necessary is that its resources and character be made known, when it must attract people from all parts of the world. For a long time the hopes of the Canadian people with regard to the Northwest were hardly realized, although they had spent vast sums in opening up that territory, and every effort was made no doubt to bring people in. But for one cause or another, whatever it may have been, the rate of progress for some years was slow and unsatisfactory. But in recent years we have nothing to complain of on that score ; there has been a very gratifying increase in the influx of immigrants to that territory. My hon. friend the Minister of the Interior has spent money freely in advertising Canada, and the time has come when the Dominion is reaping a rich harvest, and when all will admit that the money he has expended for that purpose, and which, at one moment, some were disposed to look upon with doubt, is now bearing rich fruit for the building up of this Dominion. I find that the arrivals of immigrants into Canada during the past eight years appear as follows :

The origin of these immigrants for the calendar year 1903 appears as follows :

We are glad to know that the immigration work continues actively during the present year, and no doubt at the end of the season a very gratifying story can be told.
Glance now for a moment at the extent to which homestead entries are being taken up :

Last year, Mr. Speaker, we introduced, in connection with our tariff legislation, an important change, which we believed was rendered necessary for the defence of Canadian interests. We thought that one of the great nations of the world had not treated us as fairly as we ought to be treated, and in self defence we adopted what was called the German surtax. I have nothing now to add on that subject, except to call the attention of the House to the effect that that surtax has had upon trade between the two countries. Prior to the adoption of the surtax the imports from Germany to Canada were increasing ; under the operation of the surtax, not only has the increase been arrested, but there has been a very considerable diminution. For the ten months from the 1st of July, 1892, to the end of April, 1903, the total dutiable imports for consumption from Germany amounted to S8,-
048.000,	while for the corresponding ten months of the current fiscal year they only amounted -to $5,367,162-a falling off of $3,281,438, or a decline of 38 per cent. To illustrate in a concrete way the result of the surtax, the importations of raw sugar might properly be referred to. During the last fiscal year 174,000,000 pounds of this commodity were imported from Germany, but since the surtax was applied not a pound has been imported under it from Germany. All that trade has been diverted to the British West Indies, including British Guiana. The importations o-f raw sugar from the British West Indies, including British Guiana, for the ten months ending with April of the current fiscal year, amounted to 188,000,000 pounds. For the corresponding period of the previous year the imports from the British West Indies amounted to 46,515,355 pounds ; estimated from British Guiana, 23,000,000 pounds-in all, 69,000,000, as compared with
188.000.	000 pounds for the same period of the curi'ent fiscal year. Statistics show that

the surtax has resulted also in reducing the Importations of woollens, cottons and silk goods, and articles of iron and steel. There is nothing new to be said on that question. We regret that we felt obliged to take that step, and we think that on the whole it has operated to the advantage of Canada, and it has certainly commanded the attention of the wide world. I think that the almost universal opinion has been that the action of the government of Canada was fully justified.
It is now seven years since we had a revision of the tariff. Some changes have been made, but nothing very material. That tariff, I venture to say, has on the whole proved most satisfactory. It has proved a good revenue tariff, as we are bound to conclude from the figures I have given to the House. It has included a considerable measure of incidental protection, and in that respect it will command the admiration perhaps of some hon. gentlemen opposite, who are more anxious for protection than some of us on this side of the House.


What an abomination that measure of protection is.


be unseemly on our part if we were to attempt to throw ourselves between the two political parties over there, and take	any active part in the movement. We must be content with stating our position, as it has been stated in the past. We on this side of the House accept the principle of preferential trade. We believe that, while differing in some details, hon. gentlemen opposite will not differ from us on the principle, and therefore we say to the English people that Canada is practically a unit in support of the principle of preferential trade. We must be content to leave the matter at that for the present.
We have some tariff changes to propose this session, but we have no intention of making any extensive tariff revision. Many items in the tariff, I might be almost justified in saying that almost every item in the tariff, bears a relation to some other item, and it becomes necessary to have a very careful inquiry before any detailed revision be undertaken. Before the last revision of the tariff, a commisison composed of members of the administration held a very extensive and thorough inquiry among the business men of the country ; all interests were heard and I am sure much valuable information was obtained. Before we could attempt to deal with all the details of the tariff, it will probably be the part of wisdom to have that commission or some such body make some such inquiry. The ministers in one way or another will have to make a thorough investigation before any detailed tariff revision can be undertaken.
But, while we may not be prepared to deal with the details now, there is no reason why we cannot foreshadow the lines upon which the tariff revision might take place. We have to-day practically three tariffs'. We have the British preference, we have our general tariff and we have the Gen-man surtax. I think it would be found wise in any revision of the tariff that may take place, to continue these distinctions, and to perhaps deal with them more in detail. I think it would be the part of wisdom that we should still have separate tariffs to apply to separate countries, in order that we may be able to deal fairly with the countries that want to trade with us, and to deal less generously with those countries which pursue a somewhat hostile course towards us. We have to-day practically a maximum and a minimum tariff if I may so describe it, and then we have the British preference below that again. It would be well that in the revision that may take place, we should adopt that principle as it now exists and deal with it more in detail. I| think it would be well for us to have a maximum general tariff and a minimum general tariff, and the British preference below that as we have it to-day. The maximum tariff would only be applied to those countries which pursue, if I may Mr. FIELDING.
so call it, a hostile policy-I do not mean to say that they have any hostility to us, but simply that in the carrying out of their own affairs they adopt a trade policy which discourages trade with us. In that case, they cannot complain if we have a maximum tariff, and though we should guard against having an extreme tariff, we would be justified in saying that this tariff should be materially higher than the tariff which we are prepared to extend to other countries which are willing to trade with us on fair and reasonable terms. The minimum general tariff, which would correspond to the general tariff to-day, would apply to such countries as do not legislate commercially in a spirit of hostility to us-perhaps that is not happily expressed ; let me say, to countries that adopt more moderate tariff views; low tariff countries. Of course where there are favoured nation treaties in existence they have to be considered, but the principal nations which to-day adopt a high tariff policy have not any favoured nation arrangement, and therefore I think our Hands will be free in that respect. So, we would have a maximum tariff as we have the German tariff to-day, to apply to such countries as do not manifest a disposition to trade with us. We would have a minimum general tariff to apply to countries that are disposed to trade with us, and then below that we would have the British preferential tariff to apply to the mother country and to such colonies of the empire as it may be expedient to extend the benefit of that tariff to. I think, Sir, that on this line, guarding carefully against extortionat
