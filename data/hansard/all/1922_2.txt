Mr. Speaker, Rule 13 of the House provides that a Chairman of Committees shall be elected at the commencement of every Parliament as soon as the Address has been agreed to in answer to His Excellency's Speech. I beg, therefore, to move:
That Mr. George Newcombe Gordon, K.C., member for the electoral district of Peterborough West, be appointe-d Chairman of the Committees of the Whole House.
The hon. member for Peterborough West (Mr. Gordon) was a member of the last Parliament. Although he was not present for the enire Parliament, he quickly acquainted himself with the rules and procedure of the House, and I think that all hon. members who have had the pleasure of knowing him will agree that he possesses
the ability, temperament and attainments necessary for the discharge of the responsible duties of this important office. I hope, therefore, that the House will support this motion.


Motion agreed to.
A message from His Excellency the Governor-General transmitting Estimates for the year ending March 31, 1923, was presented by Hon. W. S. Fielding (Minister of Finance), and read by Mr. Speaker to the House.
The Estimates are submitted in
both French and English, and at the next sitting of the House I shall make the customary motion that they be referred to the Committee of Supply.


Hon. GEORGE P. GRAHAM (Minister of Militia and Defence) moved for leave to introduce Bill No. 14, to amend the Salaries Act and the Senate and House of Commons Act.
Explain.


To conform with another bill that I wish to introduce, it will be necessary to have this bill become law, in order that certain salaries in connection with the new Department of Defence may be paid to the head of that department rather than to the head of the Department of Militia and Defence.


Motion agreed to, and bill read the first time.
Hon. GEORGE P. GRAHAM (Minister of Militia and Defence) moved for leave to introduce Bill No. 15, respecting the Department of National Defence.
Explain.


In brief, the object of this bill is to bring under one head the various departments of defence in this country, including the Naval Service Department, the Air Service, Militia and Defence, and the Canadian Royal Northwest Mounted Police. I shall make a more extended explanation on the second reading of the
Questions

bill, but that is the substance of its contents.


Motion agreed to, and bill read the first time.
Mr. J. S. WOODSWORTH (Centre Winnipeg) moved for leave to introduce Bill No. 16 to amend the Immigration Act. He said:
This bill has to do with the amendments to the act made in 1919. As the House will remember, at that time, shortly following the war, when there was considerable hysteria with regard to what was taking place in the country, certain amendments were made to the Immigration Act, the effect of which was to deprive those who were not born in Canada of the right to trial by jury and to subject them to deportation without trial. The purpose of this bill is to repeal those sections of the act, so that every man in this country, whether a Canadian by birth or one who has lived in Canada, will be assured of the right of trial by jury.
Motion agreed to, and Bill read the first time.
Mr. J. S. WOODSWORTH (Centre Winnipeg) moved for leave to introduce Bill No. 17, to amend the Criminal Code.
Explain.


The Criminal
Code was modified at the same time as the Immigration Act along somewhat similar lines. The legislation is all of a kind, and if the bill which I introduced a moment ago becomes law, it will be almost necessary to pass this bill in order to make the law at all consistent.


Motion agreed to, and Bill read the first time.

1.	Has any application been received by the Minister of Finance for the merger of the Merchants Bank with the Bank of Montreal, and what action has been taken in this regard?
2.	Is it the intention of the Government to hold a proper and adequate enquiry into the affairs of the Merchants Bank of Canada?

4.	What loss has been sustained by the shareholders of the Bank as a result of negligence or inefficient management?
5.	What does the Government propose to do further to impose penalities on directors, auditors and others responsible for mismanagement in the affairs of banks or other financial institutions?


In reply to the first question: The fact that such application was received and has been approved by the Government has already been made known. As to the second and third questions: Instructions have been given for the prosecution of those who are being held liable for supplying false returns to the Department of Finance, and the necessary steps are being taken in the city of Montreal to-day. We have no information which would enable us to
definitely answer the fourth question. Everything depends upon the price at which the shareholder bought his shares. If he bought them at anything like par he has sustained no loss; if he bought them at a high figure on the market he sustained a substantial loss. The House will see that it is not possible for us to give an exact answer to that question. The subject of the fifth question would be a very proper one to be considered when we reach the question of the revision of the Bank Act.

1.	Has the attention of the Honourable Minister of Marine and Fisheries been called to the following press article, relative to experiments made by the British Admiralty with a view to replacing old lighthouses by wireless stations:
ARE LIGHTHOUSES DOOMED?
British Admiralty experiments with what are known as wireless beacons naturally give rise to the question, "Are our lighthouses doomed?" The London Daily News understands that these experiments are believed to have met with success. If the principle of the wireless beacon is accepted by Trinity House, it will, of course, be an untold boon to all coastwise shipping. The number of wrecks will be reduced.
The chief advantages of the wireless beacon is that in any weather, by day or night, in fog or blizzard it can be picked up by a ship fitted with wireless as easily as a lighthouse in clear weather.
Should the wireless beacon replace the lighthouse it would be essential for all ships to be fitted with wireless. In this way the safety of coastwise shipping in all weathers would be enormously increased.
2.	If so, is it the intention of the Government to investigate this matter?


1. The experiments now being carried out with a view to utilizing wireless stations as aids to navigation are being care-
fully watched by the Department of Marine and Fisheries.
2. Any developments that appear to be of value will be promptly taken into consideration.

2.	The headquarters for administration are at present at Kingston, Ont.
3.	From 1871 to 1883 at Kingston; from 1905 to 1914, Quebec; from 1914 to 1917, Halifax; from 1917 to 1919, Ottawa; 1920, Quebec; 1921 to 1922, Kingston.
4.	From May 1st, 1905, the rank held was that of Colonel. The Corps is now administered by a Lieutenant-Colonel.
5.	There has been no officer designated as second-in-command.

Questions


Ml-. CHURCH:
1.	Is it the intention of the Government to introduce legislation for uniform daylight saving for the whole of Canada?
2.	If not, will the Government through its post offices, customs houses and other federal agencies, adopt hours of daylight saving in municipalities which adopt daylight saving hours?
It is not the intention of the Government to introduce legislation requiring uniform action in the matter of daylight saving, but the Government in regard to its official service will adapt itself to the determination of each local community.


Is it the intention of the Government or any department thereof, to sell any portion of the property in the township of Toronto, known as the Long Branch Rifle Ranges?


The matter has not yet been considered..

In reference to the ques. tion relating to Lighthouses and Wireless Telegraphs I wish to convey the information to new members of the House that it is not permissible to quote press extracts in questions. In the present case the extract was originally much longer but was reduced by the hon. member for Temiscouata (Mr. Gauvreau). The usages of the House, hon. members will understand, require that extracts from newspapers should be elimin ated from questions.

In relation to this motion, I would suggest, if the hon. gentleman would agree, that it be amended by adding after the word "document" the words "and all correspondence passing between officers of the Government and Sir Robert Borden".


Amendment agreed to.
Motion as amended agreed to.
As the fiscal year is about ended, and we shall be entering immediately upon a new year, it is very desirable that we should have an Interim Supply Bill. I have already communicated with my hon. friend the ex-Minister of Finance (Sir Henry Drayton), and while, of course, until the Estimates were brought down, no arrangement could be made, I would desire that, at the next sitting, the House agree to vote one-fourth of the Estimates. It might be convenient to vote one-fourth of the whole; but if any hon. gentleman would like any particular service reserved, we would be quite willing to discuss and consider the matter. The main point is to obtain the necessary supply for salaries of officials in the different departments of the public service.


I think my hon. friend will recognize that it is hardly possible for me to say anything to-day as to the attitude that ought to be taken as regards the proposed vote.


I quite agree to that.


I have not had an opportunity of looking at the Estimates;
but from the length of time it has taken to prepare them, I judge it will take some t'me to consider them, and the time between now and Monday would be rather short for that purpose. Perhaps my hon. friend could give me, between now and Monday, new and cogent reasons why interim supply should be voted. I confess to being at a little difficulty in the matter, because, amongst other things, I have very great respect for my hon. friend and for the precedents which he has from time to time set. At the last session of this House, apparently, those precedents which he gave us in the past were wrong and a certain course was adopted, that being a course which said that there ought not to be an interim supply vote; that consent would not be given; that it was a moral wrong to make these large interim votes without proper consideration of the items, and so on, and so forth. Perhaps my hon. friend will be able to show us that the attitude taken last year by the then Opposition was entirely in error, and that he was not free to make a new precedent for us to follow.


My hon. friend will find that there is no inconsistency between my attitude of last year and my attitude of to-day, but I do not want to discuss that. My right hon. friend is quite rignt in saying that he should have a reasonable time to consider this matter, but I cannot give him any reason further than that we desire to make provision for the public service chiefly, owing to their not being able to wait until the money is voted. That is the only reason.	[DOT]


I am afraid that the same reason obtained last year.


On motion of Mr. Mackenzie King for the adjournment of the House:
Is it intended that we adjourn at a quarter to four? Surely we should have some business to go on with. If there is nothing ready, I would suggest that we go back to the debate on the Address, when we could give the Minister of Railways (Mr. Kennedy) an opportunity of making the speech promised by the Prime Minister.


The Minister of Railways and Canals will make the speech at the appropriate time.


What business will be taken up on Monday? [DOT]
Grand Trunk Arbitration


Monday is Private Members' day. We will take up the Orders as they appear on the Order Paper, and then, if there is time for some of the Government measures, we will go on with some of them.
Mr'. MEIGHEN:	What Government
measures?


Estimates.


What Estimates?


I think, we shall take up, first, Civil Government. If it were important to mention a particular department, I would do so; but, perhaps, the right hon. gentleman will agree that while the votes for civil government are under discussion we shall be free to take up any of the items, with the understanding that if any item is objected to, it will be left over.
