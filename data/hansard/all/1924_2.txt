For a copy of all evidence or statements made before the Royal Pulpwood Commission by Mr. Piche and other witnesses, members or officers of the government of Quebec.


Mr. Speaker, with reference to this
motion, the Royal Commission on Pulpwood submit the following:
The commission desired to have a full discussion with the Quebec forestry officials which, among other things, involved matters concerning the internal policy of the Forest Service. In order to permit of frank discussion of such matters, a private hearing was requested by the forestry officials, which request was granted.
Under these circumstances the commission does not consider that it -would be justified in disclosing the evidence presented by the Quebec forestry officials without the consent of that department of the Quebec government' service.
I would therefore ask that my hon. friend withdraw the motion.


My
hon. friend who made the motion is not here. I would suggest that it be allowed to stand in the meantime. I do not yet appreciate the reason for not disclosing the evidence.
Motion stands.


For a copy of all letters, papers, reports and other documents relating to the purchase of railway ties by the Canadian National Railways or any of its officials, including correspondence with the firm or firms from which the said ties were purchased, reports on the price or prices of same, and also returns and vouchers showing the cost of all creosoting plants either under construction or completed by the Canadian National Railways, during the year 1923.
Hon. GEORGE P. GRAHAM (Minister of Railways):	Mr. Speaker, the hon. gentleman
(Mr. Chaplin) and myself promised the House that we would talk this over, but I regret to say that we have not done so yet. If you will bear with us a little while longer we will work it out.
Motion stands.


For a copy of all correspondence exchanged between any member or members of the government, members of parliament, engineers, or representatives of government, or other party or parties during the years 1921, 1922 and 1923, in relation to the wharf, jjiers and warehouse at Moser's River, Halifax county, Nova Scotia (Necum Teuch).


Mr. Speaker, I am not at
all sure that it is possible for the government to comply with this motion. The hon. member asks, "For a copy of all correspondence exchanged between any member or members of the government, members of parliament, engineers, or representatives of government," and so on. Of course, a return may be brought down of any correspondence between the government and the other persons mentioned, but the government has not any knowledge of correspondence with members of parliament.


The motion must be intended to have that meaning. The word "and" should be inserted before "members of parliament."


Yes.


Motion as amended agreed to.


For a copy of all legal opinions given by the Department of Justice with respect to interpretation or effect of the present sales tax-Special War Revenue Act as re-enacted and amended by chapter 70 of the Statutes 1923.


Mr. Speaker, I am sorry that I
must object to the adoption of this motion. Such legal opinions are given by the Department of Justice in cases which are now pending before the courts, and to bring them down would, in my opinion, prejudice the Crown. It has never been the practice to produce these opinions.
Questions as Orders


Is it the pleasure of the
House that the hon. member shall have leave to withdraw his motion? Carried.
Motion withdrawn.


For a copy of all correspondence exchanged between the Minister of Marine and Fisheries, the government of Canada, the Civil Service Commission or its employees, and all other persons since the first day of January, 1923, on the subject of the dismissal of Mr. Lemelin, lighthouse-keeper at St. Francois, He d'Orleans, and the nomination of a new lighthouse-keeper.


This is
another order that is badly worded. It says:
For a copy of all correspondence exchanged between the Minister of Marine and Fisheries, the government of Canada, the Civil Service Commission or its employees, and all other persons.
If what is sought is any correspondence the government or any member of the government has had with "any of these parties, well and good, but as it is phrased it would seem to include any correspondence that employees or civil servants have had with any person. Of course, that could not possibly be brought down.


I would say there is
no need of the words "or its employees."


Motion as amended agreed to.


For a copy of all letters, telegrams, correspondence and other documents in the possession of the government or any department of the government between the government and the government of Saskatchewan on the question of licenses for export liquor houses.


I would ask the hon.
member to let this motion stand, as there are some suggestions to be made as to its wording.
Motion stands.


For a copy of all correspondence exchanged between the Postmaster General or the government of Canada, the Civil Service Commission or its employees, and all other persons since the 1st January, 1922, to date, on the subject of the dismissal of Thomas Lavoie, postmaster at St. Gedeon, Chicoutimi county, and the nomination of a new postmaster at St. Gedeon. Also copies of the investigation that was held on the said Thomas Lavoie, and of the report of the investigators, as well as copies of applications made to the

Civil Service Commission for the position of postmaster at St. Gedeon, and all petitions and certificates given in favour of or against, any of the applicants.


This order
also is badly phrased. If the words "or ifcs employees" were struck out and the word "other" before "persons," I think the order could pass in that form.


Motion as amended agreed to.


For a copy of all reports, letters, telegrams and other documents, during the year 1917, from the resident engineer or any of his staff located at Port Nelson to the chief engineer of the Department of Railways and Canals, or the deputy minister or the minister or any official of the said department, having reference to the Hudson Bay Railway route and grain or other harbour facilities.


If this order
passes it must be with the understanding that what is unreasonable in it will not be brought down. It might be interpreted as meaning that any communication from any member of the staff of the resident engineer to any clerk in the department would have to be brought down. I do not think the mover intended the motion to have that construction.


Motion agreed to.
For a copy of all correspondence and other documents between the Dominion government and the government of Nova Scotia in respect to construction of the Port Joli-Sable Island road, Nova Scotia, and federal aid thereto; also copies of estimates, engineers' reports, applications for federal aid, vouchers and other documents relating to said matters.


For a copy of all correspondence between the Dominion government and the government of Nova Scotia in respect to construction of the St. Margaret's Bay road, Nova Scotia, and federal aid thereto; also copies of estimates, engineers' reports, applications for federal aid, vouchers and other documents relating to said matters.


For a copy of all correspondence, letters, telegrams and other documents, with regard to the dismissal of Mr. Peter Hickey as lighthouse-keeper at Fish island light, Prince county, Prince Edward Island, and if an investigation was held, a copy of the evidence and the investigator's report.

For a copy of all papers and documents, including appraiser's reports, relating to the importation of electric lamps from Holland since the 1st of January, 1923.


For a copy of all regulations made by the Minister of Customs under S.S.5, sec. 6, chapter 11, Statutes of Canada 1907, an Act to amend the Customs Act.


The House resumed from Thursday, April 10, the debate on the motion of Hon. J. A. Robb (Acting Minister of Finance) that Mr. Speaker do now leave the chair for the House to go into committee of Ways and Means.
Mr. Speaker, in commenting on the budget the other day I pointed out that it was frank and friendly. It was frank in that the Acting Minister of Finance (Mr. Robb) pointed very clearly to some important items in the figures he presented in connection with the reduction of debt which were legacies from the past, legacies which in this case were fruitful of dividend. It was friendly in that he approved of the action I took some years 85
ago in trying to tell the truth to the people of this country as to what our exact financial position was. I wish our hon. friend would stick a little closer to the text, however. I am afraid that it is idle for the country to congratulate itself upon the fact that there is some suggested diminution in the national debt. Of course it entirely depends on how you figure it;, it entirely depends on the method you adopt in your calculations. My hon. friend's own figures show that the whole surplus for the year's operations amounted to $20,000,000 odd. The salvage of former years, now applied, amounted to $9,600,000 odd. That of course, was made up, as is shown by the budget itself, in part by the writing off of our obligation on the basis of the present rate of interest as against the interest calculated upon all our bonds retired. That was something that had nothing to do with this year's operations as such. Then again my hon. friend has some further figures which amount to $1,300,000. I have a recollection of some old credits which were kept. There is one old credit which was kept faithfully and religiously. It was so old that I would be afraid to say when it started: It had to do with the pelagic sealing claims which might arise against us.
There was another one which arose out of the sale 6f the Royal Mounted Police buildings at Calgary, which was claimed to be a sum of money which could not be taken into our general accounting but which had to be held over on further future investment; and, of course there is also the ever-present balance in connection with exchange. 'I have no doubt but that what my hon. friend has done is to go back to these old matters- perhaps perfectly properly; I am not going to say not. It may be that no sealing claim will ever be made; it may be that the trust fund in connection with the Calgary property is in such a position that it could be applied to our purpose. But the point is that the whole of this $1,300,000, odd as pointed out by my hon. friend, has absolutely nothing to do with this year's operations.
Let us just see how 4he miracle happened- one year a deficit of $31,000,000; the next year a writing off of $30,000,000 of debt; the whole saving claimed this year being some $4,000,000 with a comparatively small increase in the nation's income. How does it come about? It simply comes about by treating that $50,000,000 which had to be raised for railway purposes as not affecting the debt one wa,y or the other. That is how it is all done, just a mere matter of bookkeeping; you can do it any way you like, but that is the way in which it has been done.

1326	COMMONS
The Budget-Sir Henry Drayton


Will my hon. friend say in
what respect we differed from the methods followed by himself?


My hon. friend,
I think, is wrong. I might very well say to my hon. friend that if we in times of stress, far different times from what we have today, had to raise money in a manner which was not customary, that is no answer to-day. But my hon. friend is not right even then. Any moneys which were raised in former times by a guaranteed loan and not carried into the debt, as I recollect it, were invariably either for the retirement of existing capital obligations or else the construction of absolutely new works. Now I am going to modify that again. I say that when you do that, there is certainly some excuse for it if you are retiring capital obligations; there is certainly some excuse for it if you are constructing new property; but even then, unless we delude ourselves, those sums ought not now to be looked upon as an asset, but as an addition to the debt. Why? Hon. gentlemen have not got to remember very far back to what took place in the House the otner day. we have cut down the list upwards of 8400,000,000, if not more, of moneys which we have advanced to the system as being in active assets and representing nothing. My hon. friend the Minister of Railways said, and said very truly, that further reductions ought to be made; he is right. Why, every single year we own this property we go behind in connection with it the exact amount that we put-up, having regard to our deficit account, interest and the like; so it becomes increasingly necessary that we ought not to look upon advances to railways, no matter how we disguise them, as constituting an asset which is net; it is not. Last year my hon. friend knows the railways went behind millions, and to the extent that they went behind millions to that extent is the position made just so much worse.
Let us go back to that $50,000,000 item again. The minister says that a substantial amount of that still stands on hand. I venture to say that if my hon. friend to-day has $18,000,000 of it left he is lucky, and if he has more he will tell me. But I venture to say he has not, and I further venture to say that before this year's figures are properly and finally closed, instead of having a balance of $18,000,000, his balance will look much more like $15,000,000, and I think my hon. friend will agree with me. What is this $50,000,000 for? My hon. friend says, new capital construction. What new capital construction has this House authorized? There
[Six Henry Drayton.]
is just one bit, and I am going to ask my hon. friend to interrupt me at once if I am wrong-only one bit of capital construction has been authorized and has taken place that I know of, and that is the "Longlac" cut-off connecting the old Canadian Northern line with the Transcontinental in the West. Am I wrong? Here is the Minister of Railways on the one hand, and the Acting Minister of Finance on the other; I ask them am I wrong? Both gentlemen know that that is the only bit of capital work that is being carried on, and what did that cost? It might cost $2,000,000; it might be worked up to $2,500,000; but again I venture to say that neither of these gentlemen will correct me when I say that it will not exceed $2,500,000.


Would not betterments
be included in capital?


I am coming
to that in a minute. I am taking one thing at a time and I am now taking new construction. Does the minister desire to contradict that statement?


I have not the figures
with me, blit I think probably the hon. member is wrong.


The minister
thinks so. He will not hazard this statement, that there has been one single bit of other capital new work done; and if he does not know it, he ought to know it. But the truth is there is nothing further except that small bit of work, $2,500,000, which justifies a charge against capital in so far as new work is concerned, out of this whole $50,000,000.
Next, there is a twilight zone which is exceedingly hard to find things in and define things in, and that twilight zone is the zone that exists between betterments on the one hand and maintenance on the other; it is very, very hard to distinguish there. Why, if you want to so run a railway, you can have such charges to betterments that you can relieve yourself of practically all maintenance charges, get a wonderful operating statement, and frightfully overload your capital account. Betterments? I wonder if it is going to be suggested that all the rest of this is in betterments outside of that $2,500,000. Well, if it be all in [DOT]betterments, Mr. Speaker, I marvel very much that instead of having an operating result of $20,000,000 this year, we have not an operating result of $50,000,000 or $60,000,000, because that ought to be arrived at if those methods be adopted. Betterments? Why, the Minister of Ra
