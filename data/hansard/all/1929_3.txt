Mr. Speaker, when the house was in committee of ways and means last Friday certain correspondence was tabled between the Minister of Finance and certain automobile manufacturers in Canada.

That, gentleman arrived in Otta/wa this morning and he brought to me my own original letter acknowledging his reply, and a copy of his reply.

He was referred to the provincial

Questions
authorities. It is not known if any action was taken. On January 28, 1929, Mooswa, P.O., in Tp. 56-5-4, Alberta, was re-named Lindbergh by the Post Office Department.

2.	In April 1920, the geographic board approved Alco-ck as the name of a mountain in Cassiar district, B C. The name Brown has not been applied to any feature as there are so many existing features named Brown, that the addition of another would cause confusion.
3.	Answered by No. 2.
Department of Railways and Canals:
1.	A Canadian National station has been
named "Lindbergh" in honour of Colonel Cbas. A. Lindbergh, the first solo flier to cross the Atlantic.	[DOT]
2.	In May, 1929, the name of "Alcock" was assigned to our station at mileage 18.8 on the Ashmont-Bonnyville branch in Alberta, in honour of Sir John Alcock, the first flier t-o cross the Atlantic from Newfoundland to Ireland in 1919. This was done prior to1 assigning the name "Lindbergh". The use of the name "Brown" in honour of Sir Arthur Whitten Brown was also considered, but unfortunately it could not be used on account of several stations and post offices alreadty bearing that name in Canada. Consideration was also given to the use of the name "Whitten" but that was found to be out of the question on account of there already being a post office "Whittone" in Saskatchewan. It is a policy of the Canadian National Railways not to adopt station names that conflict with the names of any ot'heT stations or post offices in Canada.

1.	What are the names and addresses of all clergymen to whom free passes are issued on the Canadian National Railways?
2.	Why are these passes issued?


1 and 2. Clergymen as such are not entitled to free transportation on Canadian railways. The passes in question are issued on account of employees of either the Department of Colonization, Canadian National Railways, or of the Department of Immigration and Colonization, Ottawa.
The issue of this transportation is in accord with the provisions of the Railway Act and of the Immigration Act, which are applicable to all Canadian railways, and the issue of these and all other passes is subject to scrutiny by the Board of Railway Commissioners as provided by legislation.
As competing lines are not required to publish similar information, the Canadian National railways management feel that it is not in the interest of the national railways that the names and addresses of these employees should be published.

2.	What was the amount of grain received into store by each elevator company and for which the so-called high powered grain tickets were issued in: (a) the crop year of 1927-28; (b) the crop year of 1928-29?


For a copy of all complaints received either by letter, telegram or otherwise, by the government or any member thereof, or by any official in relation to the periodic visits of American armed cruisers or other American craft in Canadian waters on the great lakes, or Canadian harbours, or boundary waterways, seeking enforcement of American revenue or American liquor laws, including any complaints received of said American ships firing on alleged offending vessels in Canadian waters, contrary to the
provisions of existing treaties, and a return showing what steps are being taken to protect Canadian interests and to collect damages for any breaches, if any, of treaty aforesaid.


For a return showing the amount paid out for legal fees by the Vancouver harbour commissioners for the years 1922 to date, and to whom the said legal fees were paid.


For a copy of all reports, surveys and other documents made or prepared by officials or engineers of the Halifax and South-Western Railway and/or the Canadian National Railways, or any person or persons acting on their behalf, relating to the construction, cost of construction, or anticipated revenues of a branch railway line from Riverport to Lunenburg and/or Riverport to Bridgewater, in the county of Lunenburg.


For a copy of all correspondence, letters, telegrams, memoranda or any other documents relating to the refusal of the Department of Agriculture (Health of Animals branch) to pay J. Pendrelt Smith, of Kamloops, British Columbia, for the inspection of 146 stock cars during the five months from August 1, 1926, to December 31, 1926.


For a return showing:
1.	The names of persons to whom refunds of not less than $500, under the Income Tax Act, have been made in the past five years, and the amount of such refund in each case.
2.	The names of all persons or corporations in arrears or default of income tax, during each of the past five years, and the amount involved in each case.


There is no disposition on my part to keep any information from the hon. member, but it is contrary to the principle laid down in section 81 of the Income Tax Act to disclose information respecting the private business of any person or concern. I hope, under the circumstances, the hon. gentleman will allow the motion to drop.


I do not feel inclined to let the motion drop without a statement in regard to it. I am satisfied the time has come in this country as it has come in the United States-


The motion is not debatable. We will say: Stand.
Motions for Papers


Possibly the minister could permit the amending of the motion so as to enable him to give the house the total amount of the refunds made in each of the past five years.


I will look into the matter. Motion stands.


For a copy of all correspondence exchanged between the honourable Minister of Mines, or any officers or department of the government, and any persons or firms, in any way relating to the transfer to the Western Dominion Collieries of the rights of the Lignite Utilization Board in the Bienfait plant, undertaking or equipment; also a copy of all papers, contracts and other documents in the possession of the government in any way relating to this matter.


The government will be perfectly willing to bring down everything they have in their possession in accordance with the request of the hon. member, but more than one government has been interested in this plant and of course I cannot undertake to bring down documents in their possession.


Subject to that restriction, the motion is carried.


Motion agreed to.
For a copy of all agreements, contracts or releases thereof, entered into between the Minister of Mines or any department or officer of the government and Peat Fuels Limited; also a copy of all correspondence between the right honourable the Prime Minister, the honourable the Minister of Mines or any department of the government and Peat Fuels Limited, or any officer or employee of that corporation.


Perhaps it would be wise to let this motion stand until I have an opportunity of discussing the matter with the hon. gentleman because, while we are perfectly willing to bring down the correspondence, the motion, if passed in its present form, would necessitate bringing down a great deal of matter which is entirely foreign to the correspondence. If I could have a discussion with the hon. member, I think the motion could be amended to meet his wishes and so that all the relevant correspondence could be brought down.	.
Motion stands.


1.	For a copy of report and recommendations made to the Advisory Board on Tariff and Taxation during 1927 and 1928 by Dr. W. A. McIntosh.
2.	A copy of reports of Dr. A. W. G. Wilson since 1926 on matters of metallurgical research.
3.	A copy of reports of Prof. W. R. Maxwell, when employed in 1928.
4.	A copy of reports made by J. D. Fraser since date of his employment in November, 1928.


Frequently in the course of its inquiries the Advisory Board on Tariff and Taxation arranges with the different industries throughout Canada to send experts to examine their books with the understanding that the information will not be made public. I am sure my hon. friend and the house will at once see that if we break faith with those industries, the result will be that the activities of the board will be curtailed and it will be difficult to secure information that it is desirable the department should have in order to reach a fair conclusion. Having pointed that out to the hon. member, I hope he will drop the motion. In the first place, it is not in the public interest that we should give out this information and in the second place, to do so would be breaking faith with the different industries throughout Canada.


I do not see why I should drop the motion. I do not think I am asking for any information to which the house is not entitled.
Motion negatived.


On the orders of the day:
I should like to call attention to question No.
3 which I put on the order paper a month ago in reference to the cost of dredging for the new pier in Vancouver harbour west of the Ballantyne pier. The question is a very simple one and I think the answer ought to have been given before now. Will the minister please facilitate the answer to this question?


My hon. friend understands
of course, that we had to refer the question to the Vancouver harbour commission. The answer has not yet been received, but I will endeavour to expedite it.

Civil Service-Technical Officials


Mr. Speaker, on March 6, last, the hon. member for Weyfourn (Mr. Young) presented the first report of the select standing committee to supervise the official report of the debates. The following recommendation was included in this report:
After careful consideration of the matter your committee beg leave to recommend that the present number of ten copies, four of which are delivered for the files and six for mailing purposes, be increased to twelve copies, two of which shall be for the files and ten. copies and no more for distribution by the King's Printer in accordance with names and addresses supplied by members of the House of Commons to the Editor of Debates, House of Commons.
Since that date, sir, French-speaking members do not receive Hansard at their rooms, while English-speaking members do. It strikes me that this is an unfair treatment towards the French-speaking members. For the last fifteen days I have in vain requested the Clerk of the House of Commons to have a copy addressed to my room. It seems to me that we should be placed on an equal footing with the English-speaking members, and that we should not be required to fill out certain forms in order to have Hansard sent to our rooms in the House of Commons.


I am informed that formal instructions have been given to the King's Printer that Hansard be sent to French-speaking members at the same time as they are to English-speaking members.


On the orders of the day:
Every year since I have been here I have asked the government what they intend to do in regard to the care of prisoners' wives, and I have always received the answer that the matter is receiving the careful consideration of the government. Would the Minister of Justice (Mr. Lapointe) be good enough to tell the house if any progress ha9 been made in that direction beyond further consideration?


The matter is still under consideration.


On the orders of the day:
May I ask the right hon. the
Prime Minister (Mr. Mackenzie King) or the hon.'Minister of Finance (Mr. Robb) whether they will lay on the table a copy of the order in council to which reference was made yesterday respecting the appointment of three gentlemen to deal with the question of salaries of the professional and technical employees of the government?


Mr. Speaker, I beg to table the order in council appointing Mr. E. W. Beatty, Sir George Garneau, and Doctor Murray to inquire into and report on the question of salaries of the professional and technical officers of the civil service.
REJECTIONS UNDER CIVIL SERVICE ACT-INQUIRY FOR RETURN *
On the orders of the day:


On
April 8 last the following motion was passed by this house:
For a return showing the names of persons appointed by the Civil Service Commission who have been rejected under section 24 of the Civil Service Act, in each department, for the last three years, with reason for the rejection in each case.
I would like to ask if that return, is not yet ready to be brought down. I understand, Mr. Speaker, that it is ready so far as some departments are concerned. As we require this information for discussion on the estimates, I would ask that the tabling of the return be expedited.


I understand that my hon. friend
alludes to a return from the Civil Service Commission. I shall endeavour to find out from them whether the return is ready, and shall table it at the earliest possible moment.


On the orders of the day:
Last year some questions were directed from this corner of the house to the Minister of National Revenue (Mr. Euler) asking if it was the intention of the department to carry out the recommendations of the Royal Commission on Customs and Excise, in which they recommend that prosecution be entered against Harry Bronfman. May I ask if the department have considered that case?


If my hon. friend will agree, this will serve as a notice and I will endeavour to give him the information to-morrow.

Simcoe Postmastership-Mr. Stewart (Leeds)


On the orders of the day:
My
attention has been called to the fact, though I have not yet been able to locate it in Hansard, that I committed a serious historical mistake in the course of my remarks yesterday in that I ascribed the building of the pyramids to one King Herod. My recollection of King Herod is that he was not mixed up with that, but with a lady by the name of Salome. The idea which I intended to convey was that the commission might very well ask questions in which the historical relations of people would be as much mixed as the words which I used in that connection yesterday. f


Hon. J. A. ROBB (Minister of Finance) moved that the house go into committee of supply.
1654	COMMONS
Simcoe Postmastership-Mr. Stewart (Leeds)
and it is felt that before he is definitely eliminated on this ground, a careful examination of this aplicant should be made.
Officials of the Department of Soldiers' Civil Re-establishment have also manifested interest in this case and for this reason it is suggested that this department be represented.
We understand that Mr. Whittaker is prepared to come to Ottawa at his own expense, for the purpose of being orally examined.
Yours truly,
J. C. G. Herwig, Canadian Legion of the B.E.S.L.
Mr. VENI'OT: What is the date?


April 3, 1928. The next relevant letter which I find in the file, in answer to that, is one from the Deputy Postmaster General dated April 18, 1928. I do not know just how the letter got to the Deputy Postmaster General because, as I have said, the file appears to be in some respects incomplete. However, on April 18 we find the Deputy Postmaster General writing to the Hon. Doctor W. J. Roche, chairman of the Civil Service Commission, as follows: Dear Doctor Roche:
The attention of this department has been called to a letter for-warded to the Civil Service Commission on the 3rd instant by Mr. J. C. G. Herwig _ of the Canadian Legion, in which application is made for the special examination at Ottawa of Mr. George Edward Whittaker in connection with his application for appointment to the vacant postmastership at Simeoe.
This matter has been carefully discussed, and, in the opinion of this department, there would be no object in agreeing to the proposition outlined by Mr. Herwig. According to the inspector's report, Mr. Whittaker, an amputation ease and therefore entitled to every sympathy on the part of this department, has been re-established, and therefore his claim can only be considered in common with which are usually known as class B.
According to the inspector's report, there are other returned soldier candidates belonging to this class B who have superior qualifications to Mr. Whittaker, and, as the latter is apparently not entitled to the disability preference, it does not seem that special action is called for in his behalf.
Moreover, the experience of this department shows that it is very difficult to form an exact opinion of the physical capacity of an applicant in cases of this nature, and that it is onlir by actual performance of the duties that the applicant's qualifications in that respect can be judged.
Even assuming that Mr. Whittaker is capable of performing the post office duties at Simcoe, as pointed out hereabove, it does not seem that the aspect of the matter would be materially changed in view of the fact that there are other competitors better qualified.
In the opinion of the department, therefore, the interest of the service or the requirements of the case do not demand the special action requested by the Canadian Legion.
This matter has been brought to the personal attention of the Postmaster General.
Yours sincerely,
L. J. Gaboury.

So that the proposition for a special examination of this man was absolutely rejected and he was not given an opportunity, although the Deputy Postmaster General points out that it is only by actual trial that the man's capacity can be proved. The man was not given any such trial. Then the Civil Service Commission, after having seen Mr. Whittaker, appointed him on May 29, 1928. He was rejected by the Post Office Department on June 27, 1928. The only reason I find in the file is that the appointment is marked "rejected," and Mr. C. R. Bowyer was appointed on July 23, 1928.
Now, Mr. Speaker, I wish to give to the house Mr. Whittaker's sworn statement in this transaction:
Dominion of Canada Province of Ontario County of Norfolk To Wit:
In the matter of the appointment of a Postmaster for the town of Simcoe, Province of Ontario.
I, George E. Whittaker, of the town of Simcoe, in the county of Norfolk, do solemnly declare:
1.	I am 30 years of age, I was married in 1920 and have two children aged seven and three years, respectively.
2.	That I enlisted as a member of the Canadian Forces in the month of May, 1916, when I was sixteen years of age and attending St. Andrew's college in the city of Toronto.
3.	About a month after my enlistment I proceeded overseas and in the month of October, 1916, was sent to France and subsequently became a member of the 22nd battery on the Somme.
4.	In the spring of 1917 this battery moved up to Vimy Ridge and at the end of the month of May. 1917, I was wounded in action at Thelus Wood and as a result sustained the loss of both my legs, my left leg being amputated below the ankle and my right leg below the knee.
5.	I returned to Canada in the month of December, 1917, and am in receipt of a 100 per cent disability pension.
6.	Iin the month of March. 1927, in answer to public advertisement by the Civil Service Commission, I made formal application to such commission to be appointed postmaster at the town of Simcoe.
7.	In the month of April, 1927, I went to Ottawa to personally interview the commission in order that the members thereof should be better able to judge of my ability to discharge the duties of the office for which I had made application. The two members of the commission whom I interviewed were surprised that I w-as able to move about so freely and promised to give my application their careful consideration.
8.	While in Ottawa I was introduced to the Hon. Peter J. Veniot, Postmaster General, and, after explaining to him the purpose of my visit to Ottawa, he suggested that we walk together along a corridor of the House of Commons in order that lie might be able to judge of my ability to walk about. I complied with his suggestion and he then said that he could
APRIL 17, 1929	R555
Sim.coe Postmaster ship-Mr. Stewart (Leeds)
not see anything in my condition that would prevent me from discharging the duties of the office for which I applied. He also stated that, as the Civil Service Commission gave a preference to disabled men. I should have an excellent chance of securing the appointment, and I rvas assured that he had no objection to such appointment.
Nearly a year later, and in the month of April, 1928, Mr. Murray, post office inspector from London, interviewed me regarding my disability, he having also interviewed me nearly a year previously.
I have since been informed that this inspector had reported that if I should be appointed it might be necessary to appoint an extra clerk. I then informed the member of parliament for the county in which Simcoe is situated that if I received the appointment, and it should appear after a fair trial that an extra clerk was required, I was prepared to pay the cost of such service.
About a month later I was informed that the appointment would likely soon be made and that one Charles R. Bowyer was likely to receive the same. After receiving this information I again went to Ottawa and had another interview with the Civil Service Commission and with the Postmaster General. On my second visit the Postmaster General regarded my disability more seriously than on the occasion of my first visit, but assured me several times that the Civil Service Commission had absolute control of the appointment.
About the 1st of June, 1928, I received from the Civil Service Commission notification of my appointment as Postmaster at Simcoe and, after receiving this notice, I disposed of the business which I had been carrying on, relying upon the appointment of which I had received notice.
About a month after I had received my notification of appointment, and after I had sold my business, I was informed by a newspaper reporter that the said Charles R. Bowyer had received notification of his appointment. I then interviewed him and he produced his notification and stated that he knew he was going to get the appointment before I sold my busines and had desired to speak to me about the matter but had been warned by some of his friends not to do so.
I have been informed and verily believe that my appointment as such postmaster was rejected by the Postmaster General, although I was not given an opportunity to prove that I could discharge the duties of the office to which I had been appointed.
I then wrote an open letter to the press setting forth my position and subsequently a gentleman prominent in the ranks of the Liberal party came to me and communicated an offer of a political appointment in Brantford, Ontario, on condition that I would agree not to discuss the matter any further and that I would sign a letter to be prepared for me absolving the Liberal party of all blame in connection with the cancellation of my appointment. I declined to accept this offer and subsequently the offer of this position was renewed without any condition, but I again declined to accept the position.
I have been informed and verily believe that, between the date of my appointment and the date of the appointment of the said Charles R. Bowyer, an inspector of the Post Office department came to Simcoe to interview me but, for some reason, did not do so after interviewing some other parties here.
At the time I received my appointment the postal staff at Simcoe consisted of a postmaster and five clerks and recently advertisement for an additional clerk has been posted.
Before making my application to the Civil Service Commission I made careful inquiries to ascertain the nature and extent of the duties of the postmaster at Simcoe and obtained full knowledge thereof. I am well satisfied that, notwithstanding my physical disability. I could discharge all the duties of the said office satisfactorily to the public and to all concerned. I am informed and verily believe that the Amputations Association has recommended to the Civil Service Commission that postal work is most suitable for men of my class.
I am informed and verily believe that under the provisions of the Civil Service Act I was entitled to be given a trial on probation to determine my suitability for the position to which I was appointed. Section 24 of the said act reads as follows:
"The deputy head may at any time before the expiration of six months reject any person appointed to any position under his control or he may extend the period of probation within which such person may be rejcted for another six months; and the cause of rejection or the reason for extending the period of probation shall be reported by the deputy head to the commission."
And I make this solemn declaration conscientiously believing it to be true and knowing that it is of the same force and effet as if made under oath and by virtue of the Canada Evidence Act.
Declared before me at the town of Simcoe, in the county of Norfolk, in the province of Ontario, this 11th day of April, A.D. 1929.
(Sgd.) G. E. Whittaker.
(Sgd.) Harold L. Osborne,
A commissioner &e.
I have endeavoured to place before the house the bare facts of this transaction; I have not left out anything which I consider relevant, and I submit that the provisions of the Civil Service Act which I have read have been disregarded and overridden by the Postmaster General in a harsh and arbitrary manner. I submit that the plain provision of our law giving a special preference to disabled returned soldiers has been disregarded equally ruthlessly. The report was held back from the Civil Service Commission for a period of six months, and it is quite clear what was happening during that period; the gentleman who was subsequently appointed was being given an opportunity to acquire a residence in the town of Simcoe, which the inspector reported he did not have, in order that the Postmaster General might be able to insist that this man was qualified for the appointment, In the file there is a letter written from the Post Office Department to the Civil Service Commission calling attention to the fact that this gentleman, Mr. Charles Rex Bowyer, was then a resident or should1 be considered a resident of Simcoe. On the same file there is also a letter from Mr. Bowyer
1656	COMMONS
Simcoe Postmastership-Mr. Stewart (Leeds)
which is very ambiguous and which does not categorically and specifically answer the report of the post office inspector to the Postmaster General with regard to his residence. It is not at all clear; to the contrary, I think it is very plain that this gentleman was not a resident of Simcoe and was so disqualified, but for some reason which does not appear the Postmaster General seemed determined to have this man appointed. The question naturally arises:	Why was that attitude
taken? Why was the recommendation of the Civil Service Commission rejected? Why was the offer of a special examination made by this man and the Canadian Legion so summarily rejected, even though the deputy stated that the only way to find out whether or not this man could discharge the duties of the position was by a trial? Why was not this man given a chance? I feel, Mr. Speaker, that an important principle is involved in this matter. There has been a plain violation of the provisions of the statute, and we must consider whether the statutes of this parliament may be violated in this way, whether the spirit and intent of the act shall be observed, or whether, under some pretext, they may be defeated as has been done in this instance.
I draw attention to this matter because it is not an isolated case; returns have been brought down here time after time showing similar actions on the part of the Postmaster General. I think the house will agree with me that this case deserves some consideration and, as I have said, I have endeavoured to present the case fairly and to bring out all the relevant facts. I submit those facts to the consideration of the house and, seconded by the hon. member for Victoria (Mr. Stinson), I beg to move the following ame
