Hon. BROOKE CLAXTON (Minister of National Health and Welfare) moved for leave to introduce bill No. 9, to amend the Department of National Health and Welfare Act.
He said: The only change proposed by the amendment is to correct a typographical error in the act of last year as printed. It occurs in section 12 and involves the substitution of the word "eight" for the word "nine" in a cross reference to another act.
Motion agreed to and bill read the first time.
Hon. L. S. ST. LAURENT (Minister of Justice) moved for leave to introduce bill No. 10, to provide for a prize court and prize law in Canada.
He said: The purpose of the bill is to put in statutory form and perhaps make clearer and more definite what is the common law practice in respect to prize courts and prize law jnd to replace the order in council which has oeen in force under the War Measures Act in that regard. I am informed that during the first war the exchequer court as a colonial court of admiralty had jurisdiction as a prize court, and that expired when the old admiralty court act was repealed in 1934. During this war an order in council to give it this jurisdiction was passed under the War Measures Act. It is felt that the jurisdiction of the court should be prolonged beyond the time when the order in council under the War Measures Act will be in force, and this bill is to set out what is the prize law in Canada and to make the exchequer court the court to administer that law.
Motion agreed to and bill read the first time. CANADIAN NATIONAL RAILWAYS
Hon. LIONEL CHEVRIER (Minister of Transport) moved for leave to introduce bill No. 11, to amend the Canadian National Railways Capital Revision Act, 1937.
iMr. Usley.]
He said:	This is a routine and simple amendment of the Canadian Railways Capital Revision Act, 1937. Section 12 of that act provides for the appointment of trustees, and it is therein stated that three of the trustees shall be deputy ministers and two others shall be officers of the Canadian National Railways. By virtue of a reorganization in the directorate one of these positions in the Canadian National Railways, that of vice-president of finance, has been abolished. It is therefore sought by this amendment to set up by way of resolution of the board of directors the two officers who shall be trustees representing that body. There is also a technical amendment which has to do with the three deputy ministers.
Motion agreed to and bill read the first time.
Hon. LIONEL CHEVRIER (Minister of
Transport) moved for leave to introduce bill No. 12, respecting the appointment of auditors for National Railways.
He said: This is an annual bill which provides for the appointment of auditors for the Canadian National Railways. Since the year 1932 the appointment of the auditors has been by bill in this manner, and for the year 1945 it is sought to appoint George A. Touche and Company as auditors for the Canadian National Railways.
Motion agreed to and bill read the first time.

PAYMENTS ON 1943 WHEAT CROP Mr. ROSS (Souris):
1.	Has the 1943 wheat crop been disposed of by Canadian wheat board?
2.	If so, when will payments be made to producers on participation certificates and what amount per bushel?
3.	If 1943 wheat crop has not been cleared up, when is it anticipated that it will be sold and cleared up?
[Mr. Claxton-1


1.	Yes.
2.	Although all 1943 crop wheat has been disposed of by the board to shippers and mills, the mills have not yet completed their reports to the board as to whether the wheat was used for domestic, mutual aid or commercial flour sales.
Without this information the board cannot determine the amounts per bushel payable on the 1943 crop participation certificates.
Moreover, final payments in respect of the 1940, 1941 and 1942 crops are still being made, and it is estimated that from 65 to 75 thousand cheques have still to be issued covering producer's certificates which have been lost. A further payment will also be made during the current crop year in respect of barley equalization fees, and also for the export fees received in respect of Ontario winter wheat for last season.
These operations are all in addition to the current work of the board, which is extremely heavy, and it does not appear that the necessary equipment will be available for the purpose of making this payment until the other payments referred to have been released.
It is now anticipated that the 1943 crop payments will probably begin in June or July, 1946.
3.	Answered by (1) and (2).

2.	If so, vha.t action has been taken by the government in this matter?


Perhaps I may be permitted to answer this question verbally. The Minister of National Defence has received a great many requests from hon. members on this side of the house asking that the members of this force be allowed to retain their rifles or to purchase them for a nominal consideration. The force, as hon. members from British Columbia know, has rendered very valuable service. They served voluntarily and without pay. In some cases they were issued with service rifles and in some cases with sporting rifles, 30-30 carbines. The matter has been under consideration for some time. It was felt that for fairly obvious reasons they

could not be allowed to retain the service rifles; but I recommended a short time ago that they should be allowed to purchase the sporting rifles at a nominal price. I made that recommendation to my colleague, the Minister of Munitions and Supply, with a view to his passing it on to War Assets Corporation, and he agrees that that can be done. The details will now be worked out and arrangements made to allow them to purchase those rifles at a nominal price.

When is Mr. Adrian Arcand to be tried for alleged nazi activities prior to his internment in 1940?
Mr. ST. LAURENT: In view of the large number of inquiries that have come to the department with regard to this question I think I should read aloud the answer that is being made to the question.
The opinions of the deputy minister of justice and of Mr. Gerald Fauteux, K.C., special prosecutor, now tabled, are that it is not advisable that federal authorities proceed further with charges against Adrian Arcand based on his activities prior to his internment. I beg leave to table the opinions where the matter is discussed, and the reasons for the opinions are given. I am making a certain number of mimeographed copies of these opinions available to the gentlemen of the press. If any hon. member wishes to have a copy I shall be glad to furnish it.


In view of the public interest would it not be possible to put the opinions on Hansard? I do not know how long they are, but the minister says he has had a large number of requests for them.
Mr. ST. LAURENT: I have had a large number of inquiries. It covers five or six pages. I have no objection to its being printed as an appendix-


Make it part of the answer.
Mr. ST. LAURENT: -or making it part of the answer to the question.


I think that would be better.
Mr. ST. LAURENT: Then with the consent of the house the opinions will be made part of the answer to the question.
Questions

I have considered the advisability of taking further criminal proceedings against Adrien Arcand, who in May, 1940, was charged, by way of indictment, under sections 39 and 39A of the defence of Canada regulations with having spread and published reports and statements intended or likely to cause disaffection or to be prejudicial to the safety of the state or the efficient prosecution of the war. Before the preliminary inquiry was completed and the accused could be committed for trial, the judge directed that the situation disclosed by the evidence should be brought to the attention of the attorney general of Quebec. The latter in turn communicated with the Minister of Justice, who, 'with a view to preventing Arcand from acting in a manner prejudicial to the public safety or the safety of the state, directed that he should be detained, and he was so detained until July, 1945.
It may now be stated that Arcand was the recognized leader of an organization known as the national unity party, declared by the defence of Canada regulations to be illegal. The national unity party had objects and ideals very similar to those of the fascist and nazi parties, and there is evidence of some connecting link between members of those parties and Arcand.
Whether or not the national unity party had any real numerical strength or potential possibilities, the prompt action taken by the Minister of Justice effectively quelled the movement, and the purpose of Arcand and the misguided people whom he sought to influence wholly failed. There is no evidence that his activities or those of the party in fact did any injury or in the slightest degree prejudiced the successful prosecution of the war. My information is that since his release from internment Arcand has not been engaged in any political activity and no complaints have been received with reference to his conduct.
To the question whether further criminal proceedings should be taken against Arcand, the following observations of a legal nature would seem to be relevant:
First, responsibility for the prosecution of indictable offences rests with the provincial attorney general, and, while it would be open to federal authorities to proceed with the charges under the defence of Canada regulations with the object of having Arcand committed for trial, I would not advise this course without first consulting the attorney general of the province, since he must assume responsibility for the trial if the accused is committed.
Secondly, defence of Canada regulations 39 and 39A have been revoked, and, while such revocation does not relieve from liability a person who committed an offence prior to revocation, nevertheless in the case of such a stale offence as this the fact of revocation might be expected to affect the course of the trial.
Thirdly, the maximum sentence which could be imposed for the offences charged is five years' imprisonment. Arcand has already been subjected to confinement for a period in excess of five years.
Fourthly, a proposal to prosecute for a seditious offence under the criminal code would be subject to the same considerations as apply in the case of the charges under the defence of Canada regulations, namely, that the provincial attorney general would be responsible since the proceedings would be by way of indictment, and

that the offence is stale, and that the accused has already suffered a lengthy period of confinement.
Fifthly, Arcand could not be tried for treason for the reason that any such offence has long since been prescribed by statute. In this connection it should be remarked that the Treachery Act of Canada was only assented to on the 7th of August, 1940, after Arcand was interned, and so would not apply to Arcand's activities prior to internment.
Having regard to the foregoing, I would not advise that further criminal proceedings be undertaken by federal authorities, and in this respect I concur in the view recently expressed by Mr. Gerald Fauteux, K.C., who acted as crown prosecutor at the time the charge was laid against Arcand.

Re: Adrien Arcand, Jos. C. Farr et al -Further prosecutions.
Dear Mr. Vareoe,
I have examined the brief submitted for opinion, in relation with the above matter.
This brief, I understand, after a recent interview with Inspector C. W. Harvison of the R.C.M. Police is definitely a general outline ot the case, and cannot be taken as definite and exhaustive as far as evidence is concerned.
Furthermore, I had a conference yesterday, in Ottawa, with Mr. Robert Forsyth, K.C., of your department, with whom I discussed the matter, and who, I may say, agrees with the views which I now beg to express as follows:
1.	The matter during the war:
In the spring of 1940, and as the result of the execution of a number of search warrants, truckloads of documents were seized in various places and in various provinces in Canada.
At that time, more than sufficient evidence was gathered to justify a prosecution under sections 39 and 39A of the defence of Canada regulations. And as a matter of fact, on the 29th of May, 1940, a number of warrants were issued for the arrest of the leaders of the so-called "national social Christian party" and "national unity party of Canada".
According to their own publications, their programme, I quote:
"in its main lines, and even in many details, is identical to the programme of the principal corporatist organizations of other countries:
"Fascists of Italy,
Nazis of Germany,
Cuzists of Rumania,
Francists of France,
Fascists of Great Britain,
Guardists of Australia,

Questions
Nara-ists of Poland,
Nationalists of Switzerland,
Gadja-ists of Yugoslavia,
Rexists of Belgium,
Fascists of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Bulgaria, the Netherlands, Portugal, etc." The procedures before the court were by way of indictment. In the course of the preliminary inquiry, the presiding judge, after the filing of a number of exhibits, interrupted the procedure, called the attorneys for the prosecution and the defence, for a short conference in his chamber, and immediately after resuming the procedures in court, declared that there was prima facie evidence of a conspiracy against the safety of the state, and suggested that the matter be immediately referred to the attorney general of the province; the inquiry was then adjourned to the following week. This action of the court brought no protests from the defence counsels, (sic)
Accordingly, the matter was immediately referred to the attorney general who, in turn, advised the then Minister of Justice of same and of the extension of the alleged conspiracy beyond the limits of the province of Quebec. An order for internment under section 21 of the D.O.C.R. followed.
The preliminary inquiry was then adjourned sine die.
Later, the question of prosecution for offences under the criminal code of Canada was considered. It was thought that any trial under circumstances then prevailing, would have possibly led to certain agitation and perhaps, and to an unmeasurable extent, defeated the very purpose which the defence of Canada regulations were meant to achieve.
The national emergency prevailing at that time could hardly be met otherwise than by emergency steps which, as stated, were immediately taken.
2.	The matter since the cessation of hostilities:
I have
