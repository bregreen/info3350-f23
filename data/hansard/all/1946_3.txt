"journal", mat 11
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a question of privilege. On page 1 of the Ottawa Morning Journal of May 11, the following appears:
Two cabinet ministers, Works Minister Fournier and Fisheries Minister Bridges expressed themselves in favour of the present procedure of having parliament deal with divorce eases.
And on page 18 of the same newspaper I am quoted as saying:
So far as I can see there is no way you can get around the present problem. There is no way you can impose on the people of Quebec something they do not want-
Sir, I did not say on that occasion that I was in favour of the present system, nor for that matter did I say that I was against it, and further, I did not say, "There is no way you can impose on the people of Quebec something they ,do not want." What I did say, and what appears on page 1420 of Hansard of May 10, was as follows; and I quote:
-and so far as I can see at the present time there is no way that you can get around the present system. I am sure there is no desire on the part of any one to impose upon the province of Quebec a court which the majority of the people in that province do not want.


Mr. H. B. McCULLOCH (Pictou) presented the first report of the sessional committee on railways and shipping owned, operated and controlled by the government, and moved that the report be concurred in.
Motion agreed to.
Mr. Speaker, I move that the first report of the standing committee on standing orders, presented to the house on May 10, 1946, be concurred in.


Is it the pleasure of the house to adopt the motion? Carried.


Before the motion is carried may we have some explanation of what is passing the house?


The hon. gentleman will have to ask the leave of the house, as the motion has been carried.


I think the house is entitled to an explanation of the significance of this resolution.


I was chairman of the committee, and all the bills as set out in the report were presented to the committee and agreed to unanimously.


Is it the pleasure of the house to adopt the motion?


We have not heard the motion. We do not know what we are dealing with.


Let somebody else read
it.


I understand that the hon. gentleman is moving concurrence in a report of a committee, and I think the house might very well listen to the reading of the report.


What committee was it?


The standing committee on standing orders.
(The Clerk Assistant read the first report of the standing committee on standing orders, presented to the house on May 10, 1946.)


Motion agreed to.
(Questions answered orally are indicated by
an asterisk.)
1.	Who is'responsible for the maintenance of the Canadian dollar at a 10 per cent discount in terms of the American dollar?
2.	What has been the total net profit to the Foreign Exchange Control Board, resulting from the maintenance of the Canadian dollar at a fixed discount in terms of the American dollar since 1938?


1.	The rate of exchange for the United States dollar in Canada is established pursuant to section 24(1) of P.C. 2716 dated September 15, 1939, as amended by section 13(1) of P.C. 7378 dated December 13, 1940, which reads as follows:
"Subject to any instructions that may be given by the Minister of Finance, the foreign exchange control board may prescribe rates of exchange for transactions in foreign exchange pursuant to this order with respect to such foreign currencies and such transactions or kinds of transactions as the board may designate."
Questions

On September 16, 1939, the Minister of Finance wrote to the chairman of the foreign exchange control board, setting a rate of 10 per cent premium buying and 11 per cent premium selling for United States dollars.
On October 4, 1945, the Minister of Finance wrote to the chairman of the foreign exchange control board, setting a rate of 10 per cent premium buying and 101 per cent selling for United States dollars.
2.	The foreign exchange control board does not make profits as a result of the premium on the United States dollar. The profits of the special exchange fund account in the name of the Minister of Finance which was established by the Exchange Fund Act, 1935, and has been operated by the foreign exchange control board on behalf of the minister under the foreign exchange control order since September 15, 1939, are derived from the spread between the rates at which the board buys and sells foreign exchange and earnings on investments less the costs of operation of the exchange fund account and the board. In the near future the Minister of Finance proposes to table a rejfort giving details of the operation of foreign exchange control during the war period and statements of the revenue and expenditures of the exchange fund account.


1.	Has the Department of National Revenue, Income Tax Division, sent to farmers, in recent months, forms for their 1944 income tax?
2.	Were such forms addressed by Ottawa or by income tax district offices?
3.	Will the Department of National Revenue, Income Tax Division, require farmers to file returns previous to 1944?
4.	Owing to the fact that the majority of farmers find it impossible to file a correct return of their business in 1944, will the Department of National Revenue require them to file a return for that year?
5.	Has the farmer the privilege of deducting from his income tax the cost of his income tax return, the preparation of which, owing to the multiplicity of questions and details to be answered and given, must be entrusted to an accountant, or other person familiar with accountancy ?
6.	Is the farmer entitled to deduct from his general working expenses the amount of wages that he would pay to hired men if he had no sons, which amount he does not officially pay over to his sons, but the total payment of which is used later towards their settling on a farm?
7.	Is the farmer entitled to deduct from his working expenses the amount for board which he gives to his sons who receive no fixed or regular wages, and, in the absence of wages, deduct the petty sums ivhich he gives them weekly or monthly, and which fall under the heading of ''expenses?"
8.	What is the maximum percentage that a farmer can deduct yearly from his income tax for the purchase of farm implements?
[Mr. Mayhevv. J


1.	As a continuous procedure, as information discloses the necessity from time to time, the department sends to farmers and all other persons delinquent in filing their 1944 income tax returns, the forms, together with a letter requesting compliance with the law.
2.	By income tax district offices.
3.	All persons, farmers or otherwise, from time to time as information discloses delinquency, are requested to file income tax returns in accordance with the law.
4.	Yes. The return is required. The difficulties are dealt with subsequently thereto.
5.	No.
6.	No.
7.	If able-bodied sons, not claimed as dependents, regularly work during the year, the "amount for board" and wages actually paid as such are allowed as an expense.
8.	The question pertains to depreciation of purchased implements and depreciation varies in respect of various classes of farm implements. The expected useful life of the asset is reasonably known by each farmer and forms the basis of his initial request for depreciation.


By years and by provinces, how much has there been loaned by the Canadian Farm Loan Board since its inception?

That a joint committee of the senate and house of commons be appointed to examine and consider the Indian Act, Chapter 98, R.S.C., 1927, and amendments thereto and to suggest such amendments as they may deem advisable, with authority to investigate and report upon Indian administration in general and, in particular, the following matters:
1.	Treaty rights and obligations.
2.	Band membership.
3.	Liability of Indians to pay taxes.
4.	Enfranchisement of Indians both voluntary and involuntary.
5.	Eligibility of Indians to vote at dominion elections.
6.	The encroachment of white persons on Indian reserves.
7.	The operation of Indian day and residential schools.
8.	And any other matter or thing pertaining to the social and economic status of Indians and their advancement, which, in the opinion of such a committee should be incorporated in the revised act.

That the following members be appointed to act on behalf of the House of Commons on the said joint committee, namely, Messrs. Arsenault, Blackmore, Brown, Brunelle, Bryce, Case, Castle-den, Charlton, Farquhar, Gariepy, Gibson (Comox-Alberni), Glen, Ilarkness, Little, Mac-Nicol, MacLean, Matthews (Brandon), Raymond (Wright), Reid, Richard (Gloucester), Stanfield, Stirling.
_ That a message be sent to the senate requesting their honours to appoint senators to act as members of the senate on the said special joint committee.
That the said committee have power to appoint from its members such subcommittees as may be deemed advisable or necessary to deal with specific phases of the problem aforesaid with power to call for persons, papers and records, to examine witnesses under oath and to print such materials from day to day as may be ordered by the committee for the use of the committee and members of the House of Commons and the Senate.
That the said committee shall report from time to time and that the provisions of standing order 65 limiting the number of members on special committees be suspended in relation thereto and that a message be sent to the Senate to acquaint their honours therewith.
He said; The motion before the house in a very real sense is self-explanatory. It represents the initial step toward a review by a committee of parliament of the legislation relating to the administration of Indian affairs, usually referred to as the Indian Act. It is, in the judgment of the government, highly desirable, one might almost say imperative, before a revision of the Indian Act is undertaken, certainly before the revised act is submitted to the house, that existing legislation, together with amendments that may be deemed necessary, be carefully studied not only from the point of view of the government and the taxpayer, but also from the point of view of the Indian, and in the light of his present-day needs.
Requests-I might almost say, demands- for this inquiry have come to us from representative groups of Indians, from church authorities, and from groups of citizens who over a period of years have displayed an active interest in the advancement of the Indian population of this country. It was at first suggested that a royal commission be appointed to investigate and report upon Indian treaty rights, the taxation of Indians employed off reserves, the right of the Indian to have representation in parliament, the Indian educational system, and a number of other matters. While the government from the outset conceded that the revision of the act was overdue and that the requests for an inquiry were not unreasonable, it was not an easy matter to decide on the exact procedure that would be likely to bring about the best results.

Indian Affairs-Joint Committee
As I intimated to the house at the last session, I had at that time an open mind on the question as to whether a royal commission or a committee of parliament would serve best the purpose we had in mind. May I remind the house that the welfare of the Indian is the sole responsibility of the federal government. It is not a responsibility shared by the government with the provinces. This expression of opinion applies particularly to the enactment of legislation relating to Indian affairs.
After careful consideration the government reached the decision that a committee such as the one now proposed is in strict conformity with sound parliamentary practice. The task of undertaking a thorough undertaking of the Indian and his needs is, in our judgment, a definite responsibility of parliament and one that we should not seek to evade.
It is not my intention to enter into a lengthy discussion of the resolution before us at this stage. The terms of reference, if I may refer to them as such, are not designed to restrict in any way the scope or the character of the inquiry. They are presented in the form in which they appear rather for the purpose of emphasis. It is the desire of the government that the work of the committee should be as thorough, as comprehensive and as searching as it is possible to make it. With tips thought in mind we shall do everything possible to have Indians and responsible citizens representing Indians appear as witnesses. We are not only willing but anxious to have the best counsel and advice that can be obtained from Indians and from citizens who will make respresentations on their behalf.
When I took part in the discussion of a motion to grant old age pensions to Indians at the last session I expressed the opinion that the dissatisfaction which appeared to exist among Indians was in the main attributable to certain causes which are readily ascertainable. May I be permitted to summarize what I said at the time?
I would not be fair to the house, however, if I sought to create an impression that any difficulties which exist in the administration of Indian affairs were due in whole or even in part to our lack of information as a government on existing conditions among the Indians. I am rather convinced that the measure of economy insisted upon by the Canadian taxpayer from 1929 to the outbreak of war, the demands of the war itself, more rigid enforcement on the part of provincial governments of laws relating to hunting, trapping and fishincr. and the gradual encroachment of white citizens into areas where lands, although the property of the provinces, nominally at least had been recognized as exclusive Indian hunting and trapping areas, in the main have contributed to the conditions now confronting us. In any event the need for
a comprehensive programme based on the immediate and future needs of the Indian population is becoming increasingly apparent.
The return of the natural resources to the prairie provinces and the administration of the lands by the provincial governments for which provision was made in the terms of the agreements entered into at that time, imposed greater restrictions on a number of Indians engaged in hunting and trapping. The house will be interested to learn that prior to the return of the natural resources to the provinces, a survey in 1939 indicated that over
30,000	licences were issued to white trappers in that year throughout the various provinces and territories, excluding the maritimes, while not more than 15,000 licences had been granted to Indian trappers. The fact is that as the population of the country steadily increases, and the demands on the part of the citizens for land and other rights multiply, the Indian becomes subject to keener competition in fields of endeavour where for centuries he enjoyed a virtual monopoly.
It would appear that we have reached a stage in our development as a nation when economic conditions will force us to do one of two things: (1) purchase at public expense the additional lands and additional hunting and trapping rights for an Indian population of 128,000, increasing at the rate of 1,500 a year; or, (2) decide on an educational and welfare programme that will fit and equip the Indian to enter into competition with the white man not only in hunting and trapping but in agriculture and in the industrial life of the nation. While I have no desire to indulge in over-simplification; while I realize that there are many issues involved in the proposal before us, nevertheless I feel that we have here the crux of what is usually referred to as the Indian problem. I find it difficult to convince myself that an extending Indian reserve system, imposing controls and wardships and reducing Indian responsibility to the minimum, would be or could be in the interests of these people.
The educational and welfare programme to which I have referred cannot, in the nature of things, accomplish much overnight. Nor should it be aimed at making the Indian into a white man. The Indian, as I see it, should retain and develop many of his native characteristics, and should ultimately assume the full rights and responsibilities of democratic citizenship.
I should like, with your permission, to read into the record for the benefit of the members of the committee particularly, a brief historical summary of Indian administration in this country.

Indian Affairs-Joint Committee
Since the inception of British rule in North America the Indians have been regarded as a special and separate responsibility of government. From the time of the first British settlements in New England the title of the Indians to lands occupied by them was conceded and compensation was made to them for the surrender of their hunting grounds. The crown has always reserved to itself the exclusive right to treat with the Indians for the surrender of their lands, and this rule, confirmed by the royal proclamation of October 7, 1763, is still adhered to. In 1670, during the reign of Charles II, instructions were given to the governors of the colonies which, among other matters, directed that Indians who desired to place themselves under British rule should be well received and protected. There are still of record numerous agreements and treaties, dating back as far as the year 1664, made by the British with the Indians of New England, while Canada was still under French government. Later it was found necessary to establish an office devoted solely to the administration of Indian affairs, and in 1755 Sir William Johnson was appointed Indian superintendent with headquarters in the Mohawk valley country of the Six Nations confederacy in what is now the state of New York. Following the- revolution, the office was removed to Canada and the title of the position was changed to superintendent general of Indian affairs. From that time on a continuing administrative organization has been maintained for the protection and advancement of the Indian population. At the end of the eighteenth and the beginning of the nineteenth century the department was divided. The office of the superintendent general and the secretary of the department was established in Montreal, and that of the deupty superintendent general and assistant secretary, at Fort George, Niagara; and by a general order of May 13,1816, the management of Indian affairs was placed under the control of the commander of the forces in the British North American provinces.
By another general order of April 13, 1830, the management of Indian affairs in Upper Canada was placed under Sir John Colborne, lieutenant governor for that province, while that in Lower Canada remained under military control. In 1830, by order of His Majesty's government, the Indian department in Upper Canada was separated from that of Lower Canada, the former being placed under His Excellency Sir John Colborne, with Colonel Sir James Givins as chief superintendent for the province. The department in Lower Canada was placed under the control of the military secretary at Quebec who at that time
rMr. Glen.]
was Lieutenant Colonel Couper, and Lieutenant Colonel D. C. Napier was removed to the military secretary's office to act as secretary, with the pay and allowances of superintendent.
After the Act of Union of 1840, the head office of the Department of Indian Affairs, now united, continued to be at the seat of government, which under the old province of Canada was moved from one place to another. Until 1860 the imperial government was responsible for the management and expense of Indian affairs, but in that year it was decided that the province of Canada should assume this charge. By the act 23 Victoria, chapter 151, entitled "An Act respecting the management of the Indian lands and property", the management of Indian affairs was brought under the control of the Crown Lands Department from July 1, 1860, the commissioner of crown lands being from that date chief superintendent of Indian affairs.
After confederation the administration of Indian affairs, which had been under the management of the several provinces, came under the control of the Dominion of Canada, by the British North America Act, "powers of the parliament", dominion, section 91, subsection 24, "Indians, and Lands Reserved for the Indians". Pursuant to this authority the dominion parliament enacted various legislation concerning Indians, which was first consolidated in a single act, as it still is, in 1876.
Immediately following confederation, Indian Affairs was attached to the Department of the Secretary of State, and in 1873, when the Department of the Interior was created, Indian Affairs was attached to it as the Indian branch. In 1880 the Indian Act was again consolidated, and it was provided, section 4:
There shall be a department of the civil service of Canada to be called the Department of Indian Affairs, over which the superintendent general of Indian affairs shall preside.
Chapter 28, 43, Victoria, 1880. Accordingly, Indian Affairs became a separate department and remained so until December 1, 1936, when by the mines and resources act it became the Indian Affairs branch of the newly-created Department of Mines and Resources. It is interesting to note that when the department of Indian Affairs was created in 1880 it comprised twenty-three officers at headquarters and one hundred in the field. To-day the Indian Affairs branch has a staff of about 70 at headquarters and 700 in the field. In addition, there is the Indian health service recently transferred to the Department of National Health and Welfare. These services employ a

Indian Affairs-Joint Committee
staff of approximately 600, including physicians, nurses, and other employees, with sixteen hospitals.
In 1880 the total expenditure from parliamentary vote for Indians was, in round figures, $500,000. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 1945-last year-it was, exclusive of family allowance payments, approximately $6,000,000. This growth in personnel and expenditures represents increased and extended services to the Indians.
There are at present 2,000 Indian reserves, varying in size from a few acres to five hundred square miles. The group unit of Indian population is the "band", which means a body of Indians having lands or funds in common held in trust for them by the crown. There are six hundred of these bands, varying in size from a single family to more than 5,000 souls.
The unit of field administration is the Indian agency in charge of a resident local official, the Indian agent. At this date there are ninety-eight of these agencies. Closely connected with the Indian agency organization is the Indian school system, comprising 75 residential and 258 Indian day schools. These are operated by the department in conjunction with the leading religious denominations. At many of the agencies there are farming instructors, and in a number of localities the Indians receive supervision in specialized pursuits such as fur development projects, handicrafts and other activities.
The house will be interested and perhaps a little surprised to learn that the Indian Act of 1880, with amendments made from time to time, is still in effect. It has not been the subject of a general revision since that year. The basis of this act, or indeed of all Indian legislation and policy under British government in North America, is the special protection of the Indian in his person, his property, his advancement and his general well-being. The Indian is subject to certain restrictions but enjoys a measure of local selfgovernment under the act. Those who do not wish to remain under Indian status may, on their own application if found qualified, be enfranchised by the governor in council, whereupon they cease to be Indians under the law and acquire full citizenship.
In passing, I may say that many Indians are taking advantage of that provision. Only last Tuesday I signed fifteen orders enfranchising Indians.


Is the act of 1880, together with subsequent amendments, consolidated?


Yes. We have it here; it is consolidated for office purposes only. All the provisions of the act together with the amendments are here. A rough draft of the revised act will be submitted to the committee during the course of its deliberations. This rough draft represents an attempt on the part of the officials of the Indian Affairs branch to bring existing legislation more into accord with the needs of the Indians and present-day tendencies. I am personally of the opinion, however, that before the draft is considered the committee will wish to hear a comparatively large number of witnesses who will be anxious to make representations and express points of view. The task is assuredly not an easy one. If approached in the right spirit, however, as I am sure it will be, the results should be gratifying and encouraging to the white citizen and the Indian alike.
Finally, let me say that while a great deal of criticism has been directed against Indian administration during the last twenty-five years or so, there is a brighter side to this picture, the significance of which should not be overlooked. In numbers the race is increasing; in educational effort the Indian is developing, slowly perhaps, but nevertheless developing toward a better acquaintance with the ways of the white race. His blood is becoming steadily more mixed, which, in fact, points toward ultimate assimilation. It is possible, in my judgment, to say that too much emphasis has been frequently placed upon the fancied injustice of requiring the Indian to conform to changing conditions. In the last analysis it is both just and expedient to help the Indian to adjust himself to these conditions. It is neither necessary nor merciful in the long run to encourage him perpetually to continue in a state of backwardness or semi-backwardness. Nevertheless, as I have already indicated, the process of assimilation cannot be unduly hurried, nor must it be rushed. Time, we are told, heals all wounds, and in this healing process the soars of race tension, conflict and misunderstanding will, I feel sure, disappear.
Judging by the expressions of opinion that have been given not only in this house but all over the country, showing an interest in Indian affairs, I am sure the house will agree that this resolution is the first step to be taken, namely, the appointment of a joint committee of the House of Commons and the Senate. In that committee, which will have the revised amendments suggested by the Indian Affairs branch, and where witnesses from all over the country who may desire to express opinions and give information to the
Indian Affairs-Joint Committee

committee, will be heard, I am satisfied that the work, which seems momentous in the beginning may prove not so difficult in the end. I believe that out of this committee will come legislation and suggestions in administration which will help the development of the Indian, which I am sure is the desire of the house. For that reason I am moving this motion, hoping that the house will see fit to pass it and that the committee will be set up accordingly.


As one who for many years has been interested in the study of Indian affairs and of all that pertains to the advancement of the Indian, I rise not to delay but to support the principles of the resolution as enunciated by the minister. I believe that the present minister is the first minister who has planned to inquire in a big way into every possible means of improving the whole Indian picture in Canada. With [DOT]that objective of the minister-and I am sure in this I am speaking for other hon. members of this house-I am in hearty accord.
I have often wondered why it was that the Indians of Canada, who have been so long under the control of the white man, have not advanced as rapidly as have the Maoris of New Zealand and even the coloured races in South Africa. In New Zealand the Maoris now have a number of representatives in the parliament of that country, and the same is true of South Africa. I am not sure whether the coloured people of South Africa themselves sit in the South African parliament. My memory is that they elect white people to represent them in parliament, and that these white representatives of the South African coloured races speak for them. For that reason I have wondered why our so-called coloured native race'-they are of a reddish or copper colour-have not advanced as far as the native races of the countries to which I have just referred. They have long been under the control of the white man. First they were under the control of the British-I am now speaking of the British in New York-under Sir William Johnson, the great administrator, and later under his son, Sir John Johnson. In Canada I believe Sir John Johnson was the first Indian administrator. If I may interject a suggestion I should like the minister to go down to Williamstown in the county of Glengarry some day where the first Indian administration house was built by Sir John Johnson. His house is still standing. It has passed out of the hands of the Johnson family, but I think it would be a fine gesture on Canada's part to purchase Sir John Johnson's

old house, if it is for sale, and set it up as a museum of, Indian relics in that part of Canada.
As I said at the beginning, I have been intensely interested' in Indian affairs over a long period of time. My interest ha-s necessitated some travel and impelled me to visit many reservations. In the course of these journeys to the reservations I would first seek out the chief of the immediate band or branch on whose reservation I then was to . ascertain from him all I could and to inquire into what improvements could be made in Indian administration. From what the minister has said, I have no doubt that he intends to call to the committee the main chiefs, or those who represent them, of the various bands.
I myself have paid many visits to the Six Nations in the riding of the hon. member for Brant (Mr. Charlton) and that of the hon. member for Haldimand (Mr. Senn). In those ridings are the remnants of the famous Six Nations. I am not just sure how many of the branches came to Brant and Haldimand, but certainly the Mohawks did. The Oneidas did and the Muncies went a little farther west in the county of Elgin and are still there. The Delawares were not of the Six Nations. They settled further west at Moraviantown in Kent. I believe there are Senecas, Oneidas, Onon-dagas and Mohawks in Brant. They were of the famous Iroquois tribe.
I hope that the outcome of the committee's investigation will result in a much greater advancement of Indian life along the line, economically, educationally and in a business way, so that we as a parliament may be the means of stepping them up to a much higher level than they occupy to-day. In my travels I have found a great difference as between various reserves in the advancement of the Indian tribes. As far as I recall, the Iroquois in Brant and Haldimand are perhaps more advanced than any other Indians in Canada, though it may be that some of the tribes in Prince Edward Island, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia have also made considerable advances, because they have been long associated with white men. If we compare what they have achieved with what has been achieved by members of the coloured race who have come to Canada, principally from Jamaica and the southern United States, we have to admit that the coloured race have most assuredly achieved a very great deal in every walk of life. The Indians also have achieved something-although I observe from what the minister has said, not as much as he would like to see.

Indian Affairs-Joint Committee
In this investigation I am quite sure all hon. members of this house, including those serving on the committee, will use their best judgment and seek the best possible advice to draw up recommendations designed to advance the status of our Indians all along the line. I am not going to enter into a detailed discussion at the moment, because I do not think it is necessary. I could say a great deal about the Indians, but that can be done in committee, and if I said very much now I would simply repeat it in the committee later. I feel that I have done my duty by merely rising to support this proposal for the betterment of our Indians. It is high time we did something of this kind; in fact the time is long past when this should have been done. I am not blaming anyone. Having been here for seventeen years I know that almost invariably the Indian estimates come up in the last few hours of a session and are carried so rapidly that nothing can be said to advance the welfare of the Indians, with the exception of perhaps one or two of the principal speeches. So after this investigation is completed I hope much may be done for these native people.
Many Indian chiefs have given me their views on these matters. I have spoken to them all over Canada, as far north as at Arctic Red river; at lake Athabasca; the Norman Indians near where Norman Wells is now; the Stoneys in Alberta; the Fairford River Indians in northern Manitoba, and the Moose Lake Indians, also in northern Manitoba. Perhaps I should not have mentioned any particular bands at all, but now that I have done so 1 should mention the Blackfeet Indians; and in the tribe in the riding of the hon. member for Lethbridge, right in his home town of Card-ston, I met some chiefs of this band, whose name always slips my mind.


The Bloods.


That is it. I asked the chief why they called themselves the Bloods, and he replied, "Well, you know when a rich man has a son he is called a young blood. A man who owns a fast race horse calls it a blood. We are an up and coming band of Indians, so we call ourselves the Bloods." That was his explanation as to how they got that name. It would be interesting, I believe, to ascertain the origin of all these Indian names.
Now, Mr. Speaker, following the example of the minister in proposing this resolution, I merely wish to repeat that I am heartily in accord with the proposal and sincerely hope that' it will result in a great advancement of the Indians all along the line so that they may take their place among the white men who owe so much to them. We have taken
away so much from them that we should try our best to advance their interests now. We might even consider having representatives of the Indians sitting in this house, just as the Maoris have in New Zealand. That is something which should be kept in mind in this connection. '	^


First I should like to congratulate the minister, who is new in this department and who I think is tackling this job in a way that should bring success. I am glad he is setting up this committee to give all the members of the House of Commons an opportunity to help in the revision of the whole Indian Act. It is a big job, and I think those who have made any study whatever of the Indian problem will realize what a tremendous task lies ahead. For instance, the committee has to revise treaty rights and obligations. The treaties alone require a tremendous amount of study. The committee also will have to consider band membership, the liability of Indians, the encroachment of white persons on Indian reserves, and so on. During the last few months I have done quite a lot of reading on the history of the Indians, and I find that the whole story of the treatment of the Indians by the white men has been one of exploitation all the way through. Not long ago I was talking to an Indian, who said, "The white man is very greedy. He grabs this and he grabs that," and that is so. Whenever the Indians had a reserve that included good farm land, the white man found a way of getting them to take inferior land, and it has been the same with timber. There were good timber berths on some of the Indian lands, and the white man found ways and means of getting the Indians to give up that timber. So I say it will be a tremendous job to look through these old treaties and old deeds of gift to find out just what the Indians have had to put up with.
I rise to-day more particularly to give the committee a little encouragement. I know some people have said the Indian is no good, that you cannot make anything out of him. During the Easter recess I had an opportunity to go to the Six Nations Indian reserve just south of Brantford, and I would not have missed that trip for anything. There I found very highly civilized, well-educated, cultured Indians, and I want to say something about some of the things I saw. In the first place I believe the whole reserve would average up pretty well as a farming community with any community of white people. They have eleven day-schools on this reserve. All the teachers are Indians, most of whom were educated on the reserve and who then went on further

Indian Affairs-Joint Committee
with their education. They have fourteen Indian teachers teaching the Indian children. I looked at their work and spoke to one of the teachers, and I believe the work those children were doing would compare favourably with the work done in any of the white schools. They have their own agricultural society. They have a very neat little town, Oshweken, on the outskirts of which they have their own agricultural grounds. Those grounds are neat, as everything else in connection with that reserve is neat. When you enter the agricultural grounds you go through a double arch gate, and inside to the right you find a recreation hall. I think these Indian teachers have done a wonderful work in preparing the young people of the reservation for citizenship. The recreation hall is large enough to permit the playing of basketball and softball. The young people meet twice a week and they can play these games. They are taught archery and many other things. They even have an orchestra of eighteen or twenty pieces, and also several small bands. They have a seed cleaning plant which is capable of cleaning all the seed used on the reservation.
I asked them how they were making out as far as higher education was concerned and they told me that in a number of the schools they teach first year high school but that quite a number have gone on to take higher education. I asked how many had entered the professions and they gave me a list. There is a Doctor T. J. Jamieson who is practising medicine at the present time in Detroit. Doctor F. A. Johnson is an eye specialist in Akron, Ohio. D
