On a question of privilege, Mr. Speaker, I should like to correct a statement made yesterday in reply to the hon. member for St. John's West (Mr. Browne) appearing at page 978 of Hansard. I spoke with the hon. member after the sitting concluded. I said that twenty per cent of the people unemployed in Canada reside in the province of Newfoundland. I intended to say that approximately twenty per cent of the employable people of Newfoundland are unemployed. The employable population of Newfoundland is approximately 112,000. The total number of those registered for employment wnh our national employment service offices at March 2 was 18,600, so the actual percentage is 17. I was using the approximate percentage. I might add that 13,700 of these persons seeking work are either in receipt of unemployment assistance or insurance benefits, or are waiting for their claims to be processed. The total expenditure on this account for the month of March will be almost $1 million.


With your permission, Mr. Speaker, I should like to make a statement on the strait of Canso bridge.
In March, 1949, the board of engineers which was appointed to review plans for the betterment of transportation facilities across the strait of Canso submitted their final report, in which it was recommended that a low level bridge for both highway and railway traffic should be constructed at an estimated total cost of $13,503,128. In May of the same year the Department of Transport entered into a contract with P. L. Pratley, consulting engineer of Montreal, Quebec, for the design and supervision of construction of the bridge on a fixed fee basis.
Dr. Pratley immediately established his necessary staff in order to carry out field and office investigations leading to the award of
a contract for the construction of the bridge. A contract was awarded to Foundation Maritime Limited for eight borings on the bridge site in order to establish definite foundation conditions. These borings were completed in the first week of September of last year. Negotiations were carried out by Dr. Pratley with both the province of Nova Scotia and the Canadian National Railways in order to establish the final location of the bridge and other factors.
The report of the board of engineers adopted a clear roadway width of 22 feet between curbs for the highway portion of the bridge. Contract plans and specifications were undertaken by Dr. Pratley on this basis.
The dominion-provincial conference on trans-Canada highways, at their meetings in Ottawa on December 15 and 16 last, adopted a minimum roadway width between curbs of 24 feet for all bridges in excess of 30 feet in length which were to be constructed as part of the highway system. As a result of the adoption of this standard, further negotiations were undertaken with the province in order to determine their wishes in respect of the roadway width of the Canso bridge in the light of the standard as adopted by the conference. Their attention was drawn to the fact that an increase in width from 22 to 24 feet would result in an increase in cost of approximately two per cent of the original total estimate and would also delay the calling for tenders for the work by three or four months due to the necessity of a complete redesign of the steel superstructure and foundations.
Under date of February 24, 1950, I received a letter from the Hon. Angus L. Macdonald, premier of Nova Scotia, in which he informed me that, while he agreed that the insistence of 24 feet would delay the undertaking, he considered that the bridge should be designed for a roadway width of 24 feet between curbs to allow for a reasonable safety factor in highway travel on the structure. On receipt of this letter, Dr. Pratley was informed by my office to immediately change his plans and specifications to conform to this standard.
Previous to this change, it was anticipated that final plans and specifications would have been ready to call for tenders on construction in March of this year with actual construction beginning by August or September. As matters now stand, it will not be possible to call

Questions
for tenders until July, with actual construction work on the main piers deferred until early next spring. It is expected, however, that during this year the province will undertake work on the highway approaches on the Cape Breton side of the bridge, and likewise the Canadian National Railways will undertake the necessary revisions to railway lines on the island leading to the proposed structure.


May I ask the minister a question in connection with this statement? How many people will this bridge serve?


It is not a question of serving people; it is a question of connecting the mainland of Nova Scotia with Cape Breton island, by means of a provincial highway. The Canadian National railways will also operate over this bridge.


Will the pipe line also?

5.	Yes. War veterans allowance was approved at the maximum permissive single rate of $40.41 per month, effective July 16,

Questions
1948, the date the application form was received at the district office of the department in Winnipeg. On October 7, 1948, the veteran commenced employment as barn boss with the Long Lac Pulp and Paper Company, Long Lac, at a gross wage of $7.35 per day.
As he was thus employed and self-supporting, war veterans allowance was not indicated and was suspended as from the date of commencement of his employment.
War veterans allowance had been paid up to November 30, 1948, thereby creating an overpayment of $73, which Mr. Gagnon refunded.
His employment with the Long Lac Pulp and Paper Company terminated on February 8, 1949, and he immediately applied for reinstatement to war veterans allowance.
It was computed that his gross earnings during the above period of employment totalled approximately $900. After paying for his room and board, laundry, etc., during his employment, he had $600 cash remaining according to his declaration dated February 11, 1949, and this was the amount which the board took into account, as his earnings rather than the gross amount of $900, when considering his application for reinstatement to war veterans allowance.
Furthermore, from these earnings of $600 an additional exemption of $125 was allowed for various incidental expenses, such as transportation, extra essential clothing, etc., and the amount finally taken into account as net earnings was $475.
On the basis of a veterans allowance year commencing October 7, 1948, the date of commencement of the veteran's employment with the Long Lac Company, his income position was as follows:
Net earnings October 7, 1948 to February 8, 1949, $475; balance available for W.V.A. $135; total, $610; and war veterans allowance was reinstated at the rate of $18.76 per month, effective March 1, 1949, which, with his earnings, would have provided Mr. Gagnon with the maximum income permissive under the War Veterans Allowance Act during the veterans allowance year commencing October 7, 1948.
Then, under date of June 19, 1949, Mr. Gagnon advised that he had been working since June 1, 1949, but did not know how he would be able to keep it up. He stated that he could not maintain himself on $18.76 a month and so was obliged to work.
The letter was addressed from a depot of the Marathon Paper Mills, signifying that this company must be his employers.

As he was again employed and self-supporting, payment of war veterans allowance was cancelled effective June 1, 1949, and, in the communication to Mr. Gagnon informing him of the cancellation, he was also informed that if and when his present work ceased he was at liberty to apply through the district office of the Department of Veterans Affairs in Winnipeg for reconsideration.
This letter, which was dated July 18, 1949, was addressed to Mr. Gagnon care of Marathon Paper Mills, Caramat depot, Ontario, but, as he had left the employ of that company in the meantime, it was unclaimed and returned to the war veterans allowance board, and in August, 1949, was forwarded to the district office in Winnipeg with the request that it be forwarded on to Mr. Gagnon at his right address.
Under date of September 8, 1949, the district office in Winnipeg advised that the veteran's correct address was then care of Mrs. Ernest Gagnon, Ste. Amelie, Manitoba, and that the board's letter dated July 18, 1949, had been forwarded to that address.
On December 12, 1949, Mr. Gagnon called at the department's office in Port Arthur requesting immediate payment of war veterans allowance. He was again advised that it would be necessary to reapply, but he wanted to know what he was supposed to do in the meantime, remarked that the government could keep the allowance, and walked out. The war veterans allowance board heard nothing of the case between the time of reforwarding the letter of July 18, 1949, and Mr. Gagnon's visit to the Port Arthur office on February 10, 1950.
6.	There have been two cases of assault with shooting. Other minor incidents, due to over-indulgence in alcohol or other causes, have occurred, but no statistical record has been maintained by the department.

Questions


The Canadian National Railways advise as follows:
Total tonnage (all traffic) handled at North Sydney in 1949 amounted to 64,129 tons. Considerable time and labour would be involved in order to ascertain tonnage handled between North Sydney and Port aux Basques as this would require the examination of waybills of every inward and outward shipment between the mainland and Newfoundland.

What was the total tonnage of freight routed through North Sydney via Port aux Basques in 1949?
1.	Four.
2 and 3. The principal restriction on Canadian diplomats in the U.S.S.R. is an order of the Soviet foreign ministry of September 30, 1948, prohibiting foreign diplomats in Moscow from travelling to a very large number of

Questions
places beyond a radius of 50 kilometres from Moscow, and most localities within that area. The list of places includes the Soviet Socialist republics of Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldavia, Finno-Karelia, Azerbaijan, Armenia, Turkmenia, Uzbekia, Kirghizia, Tajikistan, Kazakstan, and most of the Ukraine and Byelorussia, including Kiev and Minsk, the capitals of the two latter republics, which are, it will be recalled, members of the United Nations.
Some areas still remain accessible to foreign diplomats on condition that advance information about the proposed journey is given to the Soviet foreign ministry. Since the Soviet order was issued some members of the staff of the Canadian embassy in Moscow have been permitted to travel to Yaroslavl and Rybinsk, Kuibishev and Stalingrad.
This seems to be the only formal restriction placed by the Soviet authorities on our diplomats in Moscow but many Soviet administrative requirements, which are unobjectionable in principle, are applied in a restrictive and hampering fashion.
There are also restrictions placed on Soviet citizens in their dealings with all foreigners, including diplomats, such as the decree of December 18, 1947, regulating the relations between Soviet officials and foreigners.
Finally the hostile attitude of the Soviet government and the Soviet press has had the effect of convincing the citizens of the U.S.S.R., with few exceptions, that association with foreigners is dangerous, and hence the usual contacts of diplomats with ordinary people, and even Soviet officials, are greatly restricted.


1.	How many Canadians are at the present time
employed with diplomatic status in each of the following countries:	(a) Hungary:	(b) Bulgaria;
(c) Albania; (d) Roumania; (e) Czechoslovakia; (f) Poland: (g) Yugoslavia?
2.	What restrictions are placed on them?


1.	(a) Nil; (b) nil; (c) nil; (d) nil; (e) three; (f) three (g) three.
2.	No formal restrictions are placed on our diplomats in Czechoslovakia, Poland and Yugoslavia. But the same considerations mentioned with regard to the U.S.S.R. also apply in varying degrees to Czechoslovakia and Poland. It is not so much a question of carefully spelled out restrictions on our diplomats, as a general campaign by the governments of Poland and Czechoslovakia among their peoples to make it unhealthy for them to

associate with foreigners. For example, the expulsion by the Czechoslovak government of two non-diplomatic members of the air attache's staff in Prague was apparently motivated by a desire to get rid of two foreigners who had built up over two years a small circle of Czech friends.
So far our diplomats have escaped the more drastic treatment which has been recently meted out to some other representatives of the western powers in the satellite countries, but there has been pressure on our locally-employed staff in Czechoslovakia. One Czech clerk at the Canadian legation in Prague failed to report for work one day. All that has been learned of him since then was that he had been "detained by the police" and that he was in the local prison where political offenders are usually held. Another Czech clerk was refused a permit to continue working at the legation.
The cumulative effect is, of course, to isolate the western diplomatic missions from contact with the peoples of the countries where they are stationed, and to restrict very considerably the normal functioning of a diplomatic mission.


Are there any Canadian trade or cultural organizations operating in any of the following countries: (a)	U.S.S.R.;	(b) Hungary; (c) Bulgaria; (d)
Albania; (e) Czechoslovakia; (f) Poland:	(e)
Yugoslavia?


Canada maintains diplomatic missions in the U.S.S.R., Czechoslovakia, Poland and Yugoslavia. These missions have, among their other duties, the task of trying to develop trade and cultural relations in so far as this is possible in existing conditions with the countries where they are located. Canada does not maintain any missions in Hungary, Bulgaria and Albania.


1.	Have any surveys been made by P.F.R.A. along the Saskatchewan or Carrot rivers in northeastern Saskatchewan or northwestern Manitoba, with a view to preventing flooding or reclaiming flooded land in these areas?
2.	If so, what reports or recommendations to the government were made, as a result of these surveys?
3.	If not, will the government give consideration to having this work done?


1.	Yes, with a view to determining whether land can be reclaimed or flooding prevented.
2.	Surveys not yet completed.
3.	See answers to Nos. 1 and 2.


1.	What are the qualifications for the granting of a subsidy for Canadian merchant marine vessels whose owners desire to continue to operate under the Canadian flag?
2.	In view of the employment situation in Nova Scotia, will every consideration be given to Nova Scotia ships operating in the foreign trade with Nova Scotia crew members?


1.	The financial relief which it is proposed to grant the shipping industry is temporary and for one year only.
To qualify, ship owners must agree (a) to operate vessels for a period of one year; (b) to employ Canadian domiciled crews.
It is anticipated that some forty vessels will be assisted, and these will be selected on the basis of their usefulness to Canada in the event of an emergency. The employment of Canadian domiciled crews will ensure the maintenance in Canada of a nucleus of trained merchant seamen to man these and other ships which Canada may have at her disposal should a state of emergency arise.
2.	Yes, every consideration. It must be borne in mind that the employment of seamen from any particular area will to a large extent depend upon the owners' and operators' desire to avail themselves of the assistance afforded by the government.
