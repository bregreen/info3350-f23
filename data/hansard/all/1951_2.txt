Mr. Speaker, on a question of privilege I should like to draw to the attention of the house for a few minutes the very informative and highly enjoyable trip a group of us were privileged to make to the city of Saint John.
We live in a wide and large country indeed. In our younger days we all had to memorize facts and figures about the other cities and provinces of our great country. During the last war some of us were able to pay short visits to, or at least go through most of, the provinces of Canada, but of course we saw them only in the dark and sombre attire of war. The need of first-hand knowledge, the need to know better our sister cities and provinces, is constant.
Our short stay in Saint John was indeed a revelation to many and a most enjoyable experience to all. To be shown the actual efforts, to see for ourselves the concrete achievements, to witness the possibilities of the future, and to hear the enthusiastic and genuine professions of faith of the people of Saint John in their proud city which their meticulous and gracious hospitality has so endeared' to us, is certainly an occasion worthy of mention in this house. I know I speak for the entire group when I say we are genuinely grateful to our congenial and devoted friend and fellow member for Saint John-Albert (Mr. Riley) for his kind invitation to visit his city. We and our wives were very proud to be part of the Dan Riley flock for the week end. More attentive and efficient direction I am sure would not have been possible.
Our sincere and deep gratitude is also unreservedly extended to the Saint John board of trade, our gracious host in the city. With complete disregard of themselves, the members of that organization made available generous accommodation and carried out elaborate arrangements to ensure to us a most enjoyable stay, giving us the opportunity to learn a great deal about them and get to know them better. We are particularly indebted to the president and his charming wife, Mr. and Mrs. Wasson. We wish to
thank His Honour Lieutenant Governor MacLaren for his highly appreciated hospitality and his spirited and most enjoyable company; also the government of New Brunswick and its popular premier, Mr. McNair, for their complimentary entertainment and kind hospitality, as well as His Worship Mayor George E. Howard and his lady. Our gratitude is also extended to Mr. Crump and his company for the 'concern and courtesy shown us all through the trip and particularly for their grand and unique hospitality on the proud Empress of Canada. We salute Captain Dobson.
Our thanks also go to the Saint John Dry-dock Company Limited and Saint John Marine Transport Limited for the opportunity they gave us to view the city and the harbour from the sea. We also extend our thanks to Senator McLean and Mr. Brennan, to the various industries of Saint John, to the various devoted committees and all those who made their facilities available to us, and finally to all the citizens of that city. It was with a deep sense of gratitude that we said au revoir, and it is with the same feeling that we say thank you.


that the first report of the standing committee on miscellaneous private bills, presented to the house on Thursday, March 1, be concurred in.


Motion agreed to.
Bill No. 115, to incorporate Trans Mountain Oil Pipe Line Company.-Mr. Laing.
Bill No. 116, respecting British Columbia Telephone Company.-Mr. Applewhaite.
Bill No. 117, to incorporate Canadian-Montana Pipe Line Company.-Mr. Bennett.
Bill No. 118, to incorporate Border Pipe Line Corporation.-Mr. Robinson.
Mr. Speaker, I believe this is the correct place for me to ask for leave to move, seconded

Wheat
by the member for Melfort (Mr. Wright), the adjournment of the house under standing order 31 for the purpose of discussing a definite matter of urgent public importance, namely, the failure of the government to meet the legitimate demands of wheat producers by announcing a final payment of 8.3 cents per bushel for wheat in the five-year pool, when farmers are entitled to a final payment of not less than 25 cents.
In view of a meeting being held in Regina tomorrow by representatives of western agriculture, I believe that this is a matter of urgent importance.


Standing order No. 31 reads: Leave to make a motion for the adjournment of the house (when made for the purpose of discussing a definite matter of urgent public importance) must be asked after the ordinary daily routine of business (standing order 15) has been concluded and before notices of motions or orders of the day are entered upon.
I have a recollection that last year I made a ruling that the motion should be made after questions and before the orders of the day are entered upon. However, without deciding definitely upon that, I shall go on with the second paragraph:
The member desiring to make such a motion rises in his place, asks leave to move the adjournment of the house for the purpose of discussing a definite matter of urgent public importance, and states the matter.
The hon. member has done that.
He then hands a written statement of the matter proposed to be discussed to the speaker, who, if he thinks it in order and of urgent public importance, reads it out and asks whether the member has the leave of the house. If objection is taken, the Speaker requests those members who support the motion to rise in their places and if more than twenty members rise accordingly, the Speaker calls upon the member who has asked for leave.
I must decide whether the motion is in order. There is some doubt as to whether this is the proper time to make such a motion. Without deciding that point I shall allow the motion to stand on this occasion as being in order. I must also decide whether the question is of urgent public importance. My recollection is that when the announcement was made concerning this payment, the Prime Minister (Mr. St. Laurent) stated there would be ample opportunity to debate this matter when the house went into committee of supply on the supplementary estimates, which he stated would be brought down shortly. If my memory serves me correctly,
I understood the Minister of Finance to say that would be within about ten days, which would be the end of this week or the beginning of next.
The member moving the motion has stated there is to be a meeting in Regina tomorrow.
I do not know the nature of the meeting, but 
even so, it would seem to me this question can be fully discussed in the near future, so it would not come within the rule concerning urgency. I cannot allow the motion to stand.

These data are based on the sample labour force survey of the dominion bureau of statistics. In this survey, persons with jobs are made up of two groups: (1) those who did any work in the survey week for pay or profit or who did unpaid work which contributed to the running of a farm or business operated by a relative; (2) those who had jobs but did not work during the survey week because of illness, bad weather, vacation, labour dispute, or temporary lay-off with definite instructions to return to work within 30 days of the time of being laid off.
3.	Information on the number of persons unemployed in Canada is obtained from two main sources.
First, the sample labour force survey of the dominion bureau of statistics provides estimates of the total number of persons without jobs and actively seeking work at four quarterly intervals each year. This information for Canada as a whole for the periods closest to January for which information is available was as follows:
February 21, 1948	 156,000
November 20, 1948	 106,000

The labour force data on the number of persons without jobs and actively seeking work do not include any persons who worked from 1 to 14 hours in the survey week, some of whom no doubt were looking for regular full-time jobs. They also do not include those persons who had jobs but did not work at them during the survey week because of bad weather, temporary lay-off, illness and other reasons. Some of these workers would be eligible for unemployment insurance benefits and therefore might be registered with the national employment service.
In respect to the national employment service data, it must be remembered that not all unemployed workers register at employment offices, and that some of those who do might find jobs of their own and not notify the national employment service. In this latter case, their applications remain on file for either fifteen or thirty days after they

were last in touch with the office, depending on whether or not they were also claiming unemployment insurance benefits.

How many displaced persons were brought to Canada during the year 1950?


22,906.


1.	How much butter did the dominion government and its agencies have in storage on December 31,
1950?
2.	To what firms or individuals did the government through its agencies sell butter during the months of January and February, 1951?
3.	What amount of butter was sold to each firm, or individual, and at what price in each case?


Return tabled.


For a copy of the notice recently published at Quebec by the Laval students employment committee and signed by one named Racine, concerning positions to be filled in connection with the census.


Return tabled.
CENSUS COMMISSIONERS Mr. Pouliol:
For a copy of all instructions given to the census commissioners since their appointment.


Return tabled.


For a copy of all correspondence between one named Jean Jacques Lefebvre, of the dominion bureau of statistics, at Ottawa, and the census commissioners, and any officer of the unemployment insurance commission, since the appointment of the census commissioners.


There is no correspondence between one Jean-Jacques Lefebvre of the dominion bureau of statistics and the census commissioners.


Dropped.


For a copy of all letters dated since July 1, 1950, written to the civil service commission or to the
Motions jor Papers
chairman or secretary thereof by employees or former employees of the government printing bureau.


There is no desire to withhold any information that the hon. member may wish to get; but I am informed that the files are kept in such a way that, to comply with the order as it would be drafted on this motion, would involve going over all the files of the correspondence with anyone who since that date has been in the employ of the printing bureau. I do not think the hon. member would wish to have unnecessary work done. If he could indicate in a more precise manner what he really wishes to get, there would be no objection to endeavouring to comply with the request.


I	wonder if	the	Prime
Minister would be satisfied if I indicated in a brief word now the kind of letters that are sought by this motion.


Reword it.


I	am asking	the	Prime
Minister.


I am sure the hon. member does not want a lot of unnecessary work done. If he can say anything that would limit the amount of work that would be required, we should be glad; there is no desire to delay the return.


The request I am making is for letters since July 1, 1950, complaining about working conditions in the printing bureau, and for letters from employees who have left the bureau, stating the reasons why they left.


They are not catalogued in that way. We can get from the printing bureau all the names of those who have left, and go through their files to see if they stated the reasons why. If that is satisfactory I will see that it is done.


Dropped.


Is the motion to be carried or dropped?


I suggest that the house might carry the motion subject to the conditions which have been indicated by the Prime Minister and which I have accepted.


No.


Perhaps the hon. member will reword his motion.


Dropped.


Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister stated! certain conditions, and I am prepared to accept them. Is that not satisfactory?

Business of the House Mr. St. Laurent: If it is satisfactory to deal only with the files of those who have left the service since the date mentioned, I think we can have them gone through.


Motion carried, in accordance with the last statement made by the Prime Minister.


For a copy of all letters, telegrams, memoranda, or other documents between any minister, department, official, or the government of Canada and any minister, department, official, or His- Majesty's government of the United Kingdom, relating to the final settlement of the four-year agreement, 1946, for the sale and purchase of Canadian wheat, including correspondence, and other documents relating to the price agreed to be paid during the last two years of the agreement.


I ask the hon. member if he would allow this motion to stand for a few days. There is no desire to delay the matter, but we should like to get together whatever the terms of this motion would cover-and they are fairly broad-and then determine as to which of them there should be a conference with the representatives of the United Kingdom government before an order is made.


That would be satisfactory to me. I think it is a matter of some public interest and urgency, but I am glad to agree to that suggestion.


Stand.


That when this house adjourns on Wednesday, March 21, 1951, it stand adjourned until Monday, April 2, 1951.
He said: If it is the pleasure of the house that this motion be considered at this time,
I shall be glad to move it; otherwise I would not want to insist on doing so.


Agreed.


Does the house agree that the motion should be put now?


Agreed.


Before the motion is adopted,
I should like to know whether the members will be paid for the month of March before thejT leave for their Easter holidays.


I can assure the hon. member that full consideration will be given to the desirability of doing that, if the rules allow it.


Motion agreed to.
that the house go into committee at the next sitting to consider the following resolution:
That it is expedient to present a measure to increase the number of members of the Yukon territorial council from three to five.
He said: His Excellency the Governor General, having been made acquainted with the subject matter of this resolution, recommends it to the consideration of the house.


Motion agreed to.
On the orders of the day:
I should like to address a question to the Postmaster General or, in his absence, to the parliamentary assistant. Has the Postmaster General or the parliamentary assistant any comments to make regarding the grievances voiced by the letter carriers at a meeting held in Toronto yesterday?


The hon. member was kind enough to hand me a copy of his question shortly before I came into the house. Notice of a similar question was received from the hon. member for York South (Mr. Noseworthy), and early last week the hon. member for Spadina (Mr. Croll) also inquired of me outside of this house about this reduction in the letter carriers' staff and made somewhat the same representations.
The meeting of letter carriers in Toronto has also been brought to my attention, in the absence of the Postmaster General from the city on official business, by the hon. member for Trinity (Mr. Conacher), the hon. member for Davenport (Mr. Hellyer), the hon. member for Rosedale (Mr. Henry), and the hon. member for High Park (Mr. Cameron)-


And the member for
Eglinton.


-who, I understand, were present at that meeting and who expressed their desire to see the Postmaster General about it tomorrow when he returns to the city.
In the meantime, the department has no information concerning the proceedings at that meeting other than that published in the newspapers.


That is sufficient.


A clipping from he Globe and Mail dealing with this matter was handed to me before the lunch hour. Until we have an official report from our officials in Toronto, therefore, on the nature of the complaints and grievances aired there, it is not possible to make a complete statement about them; although this will be done, if deemed necessary, either by the Postmaster General or by myself as soon as possible.
However, I wish to draw to the attention of the house the fact that the department is in daily communication with postmasters throughout Canada in regard to the changeover to the one delivery on residential walks.
Much of what is reported to have been said at that meeting is not apparently borne out by the facts. The letter carriers and other postal workers have associations employing paid officers who have full access to postmasters and to headquarters officials, including the deputy postmaster general, at all times.
No man is being asked or expected to work more than forty-four hours a week. None of them can expect to work less. In every individual case where it is claimed, or where there is any indication, that the hours are in excess of this, the full facts are being obtained, and adjustments will be made promptly. The associations concerned have not as yet submitted anything to indicate that, other than the temporary dislocation due to the change-over, there are any grounds for continued grievance on the part of the men.
To repeat, every individual case will be checked and adjustments made on the basis of facts. May I be permitted to add that the Postmaster General informed me on Friday that on his return to Ottawa tomorrow he wished to make a full statement to the house on this reduction in letter carrier delivery now being applied throughout the country.


What about the double loads they carry?


May I ask the parliamentary assistant to the Postmaster General whether in the course of this inquiry, which I hope will be regarded as an urgent matter, action will be taken not only on the protests of the letter carriers, which are urgent, but also on the storm of protests from people who are getting their mail delivered about five or six o'clock in the afternoon?


What about economies?


The Minister of Finance
made a remark, Mr. Speaker, that I think deserves comment. He said: "What about economies?" This is not simply a matter of
Inquiries of the Ministry economy. We all want to see economy. This is a question of humane treatment and seeing that fair play is done. It is not a question of economy; it is a question of lack of common sense.


May I ask the parliamentary assistant a supplementary question? He mentioned that the department has been in contact with postmasters. Has the department been in contact with the men, or with representatives of the men through their associations?


I presume that our circulars sent to all postmasters were duly brought to the attention of the postal employees concerned.


On the orders of the day:
I should like to direct a question to the Postmaster General, or in his absence perhaps his assistant can answer. Will the Postmaster General tell the house whether the postmasters who are not civil servants will receive the same proposed increase in salary benefits as those who are civil servants? If so, when may they expect to receive the same?


May I take this question as notice?


On the orders of the day:	.
I have three questions to ask different ministers, Mr. Speaker. May I ask them consecutively?


I hope they are not questions that should be on the order paper.


The first is to the Minister of Justice. Has there been an attempted sabotage of industrial production at Oshawa, Ontario, by communists? Has there been a deliberate communist campaign to slow down production and upset the morale of industrial workers engaged in defence production at Oshawa?


I thank my hon. friend for having given me notice of these questions. Immediately upon receipt of them I got in touch with Commissioner Wood of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police during the lunch hour, and requested him to get in touch with the appropriate officers of the mounted police to secure the

Inquiries of the Ministry information which is required in reply to these questions. Up to the present time I have not received that information; therefore I would suggest that I bring it down tomorrow.


On the orders of the day:
May I
direct my next question to the Minister of Labour or to his parliamentary assistant? Has the minister knowledge of the exploitation of men brought from Newfoundland to work with Ontario lumber companies?


I wish to thank the hon. member for his courtesy in sending me notice of his question. In the time at my disposal I have made an inquiry and I am now in a position to give him the following information in answer to his question.
Arrangements were made by our national employment service to provide transportation at federal government expense between October 1 and December 31 last for 301 men from Newfoundland who volunteered to work in northern Ontario lumber camps. The following orders were placed with the employment service, and the following number of men were dispatched: Great Lakes Paper Company, Fort William, 42 men; Abitibi Power and Paper, Hurkett, 66 men; Brampton Paper Company, 25 men; Marathon Pulp and Paper Company, 44 men; Pineland Pulp and Paper Company, Sudbury, 25 men; Gillies Brothers, Braeside, 50 men; Spruce Falls, Kapuskasing, 49 men, total 301 men. All these companies, Mr. Speaker, are known and recognized as running first-class camps.
The six dissatisfied men mentioned by my hon. friend in his notice are the only men of the 301 who have expressed any dissatisfaction with the working conditions in the camps. Four of them have been placed* to their satisfaction with the Driftwood Timber Company at Hearst, and the remaining two have chosen to return to Newfoundland.
Finally, as to the complaint that no stamps were affixed in the insurance books of these gentlemen, I may say that they had been working for companies that complied with regulation 14 of the unemployment insurance contribution regulations under which these companies have chosen to pay the contributions by bulk payments at specified periods determined by the commission.


On the orders of the day:
My final question is to the Minister of National Defence. Is it true that a commonwealth conference is to be held in London in May to discuss Middle East defence, increase in armament production, the guarding of supply lines and: the Pacific pact? Is it proposed to purchase British-made jet bombers?


These questions have to do with a conference which it is suggested may take place a month or two hence. I think the questions should be placed on the order paper.


On the orders of the day:
I have two questions, both of which I should like to deal with while I am on my feet. I should like to direct the first one to the Secretary of State for External Affairs. It has to do with Ross McLean, former Canadian government film commissioner. My question is this. Does he know who was responsible for his appointment as head of the film visual information division of the United Nations educational, scientific and cultural organization in Paris?


Order. The question is one which should be placed on the order paper.


On the orders of the day:
Mr. Speaker, I should like to ask a question, a copy of which has been given to the Minister of Public Works. Owing to the inconvenience to -the farmer and business people on both sides of the Red river at Lockport anticipating a long period of obstruction due to the fact that the dominion government has intimated it will close the bridge to traffic on May 1 for repairs-


Order.


-will the Minister of Public Works delay this action for a period of at least three years?


Mr. Speaker, I think the hon. member is overdoing it. Last fall we did give a contract for the repair of the superstructure

roadway on the bridge at Lockport. The work was begun in the fall. It was discontinued during the winter months and will be resumed around May 1. I do not think we should interfere in the execution of the contract. If the hon. member is referring to the closing of the locks at St. Andrews, I may say that we shall be guided by the water level as time goes on.


I have a supplementary question. Last year, when the bridge was under repair-


Order.


I wish to ask a supplementary question.


Sit down.


Will steel be made available when the work is started?


I will refer that question to one of my colleagues, and when I get an answer I will let the hon. gentleman know.


Order. A question asked when the orders of the day are called must not be one which would provoke debate. Questions must be brief and urgent.


On the orders of the day:
Mr. Speaker, I should like to ask a question of the Prime Minister. In view of the statement appearing in this morning's press to the effect that the cost of living index had risen nearly three points in January, does not the government consider the time has now arrived for the setting up of-


Order. That is not a question which should be asked on the orders of the day.


The government is waiting for 200.


On the order:
Third reading of Bill No. 24, an act to confer certain emergency powers upon the governor in council.-The Prime Minister.
Mr. Speaker, when the debate
Defence Production Act closed on Friday night the Minister of Public Works (Mr. Fournier), outlining the order of business, said:
On Monday we will continue this debate-
And that was the debate in connection with the setting up of the Department of Defence Production.
-with the hope that we may reach a decision.
Then he went on to outline other business. I would suggest that that course be followed.


Mr. Speaker, if there is any objection to third reading of this bill being taken today, I would say there is no desire on the part of the government to insist. It can go over, and be announced tonight to be considered tomorrow.
Order stands.


The house resumed, from Friday, March 2, consideration of the motion of Mr. St. Laurent for the second reading of Bill No. 77, respecting the department of defence production.
Mr. Speaker, I wish to make one brief comment on Bill No. 77 before the motion for second reading is put. I think it is axiomatic that legislation should be as brief and direct as possible. Much would have been saved in the printing of the bill, time would have been saved in this house and the courts in the interpretation of it, it would have been much more direct in its terms and certainly would have had the same effect, if the government had simply introduced a bill of only three sections, worded somewhat to this effect:
1.	This act may be cited as the Defence Production Act.
2.	"Minister" means the Minister of Defence Production.
3.	The minister shall be and be deemed to be, to all intents and1 purposes whatsoever, omnipotent.


Motion agreed to, bill read the second time and the house went into committee thereon, Mr. Dion in the chair.
On section 1-Short title.
Mr. Chairman, before proceeding with the discussion in committee, in view of the fact that there has already been an indication of willingness to make at least one amendment, may I ask the Prime Minister if as a result of the discussions which have already taken place he could indicate whether the government proposes to offer any amendments and, if so, what sections they will cover.

Defence Production Act


Mr. Chairman, we are not proposing to introduce any amendments. On the detailed discussion of the sections if it appears that amendments would make them more effective or workable, they can be considered as they come up. The government's proposal is the bill as printed.


Some time ago I asked the Minister of Trade and Commerce if he would answer a question regarding the plan of production with respect to specific items, namely planes, tanks, guns, vehicles and small arms. He was kind enough to say he would give an answer on the bill. We have now arrived at the committee stage, and I would now ask the minister if he would make that statement.


Mr. Chairman, my hon. friend perhaps does not remember it, but he answered that question on Friday evening himself in considerable detail, during the discussion of the bill. I do not think I need go over it. The bill does not deal with the production of planes, guns, tanks and so on. It deals with an act to set up a department of government.


I believe the items I mentioned are very important ones which will be handled by that department. If the minister did not intend to make a statement, then I would ask him now why he said when he spoke on the matter a week ago last Friday, that he would be glad to make a statement. I quoted his statement in Hansard.


This is not the exact time to do it.


Mr. Chairman, this is the appropriate section under which to make any general observations concerning the measure now before us. I wish to speak to some aspects of the bill generally, and particularly in regard to some of those which have already been discussed and which I hoped might have been amended by the government as a result of that discussion.
One of the things I should like to emphasize in regard to this measure is a point I had hoped would appeal to the Prime Minister, particularly in view of the explanation he gave of the emergency powers bill. When that measure was before us he explained that while it contained many of the provisions appearing in the War Measures Act, it was not deemed advisable to create the impression in the minds of the Canadian people that we have yet reached the stage where we should regard ourselves as being in a state of war. I indicated my support of that view. I said on that occasion that I thought the more it


was possible to emphasize in the minds of the people of Canada that our efforts are directed toward peace, the better it would be in carrying out the work we have under way.
This bill, instead of following the idea put forward by the Prime Minister (Mr. St. Laurent) at that time, deals with the production of defence materials in a way that goes beyond the powers conferred upon the minister responsible for defence production at the height of the last war. Reference has been made already to a number of the provisions of this bill which go very far and which it will perhaps be more appropriate to discuss when we are dealing with the individual sections. I would point out, however, that this bill goes very much farther than the munitions and supply act. It confers upon the minister as the minister, and not limited to cases in which he has the approval of the governor in council, powers which extend to some of the most important aspects of the Canadian economy.
I would suggest, as others suggested when the bill was up for second reading, that at a time when we are seeking to preserve all the desirable features of democracy it is most desirable that we make sure that we preserve democracy within parliament itself where the final test of our whole democratic system is going to take place. After all, democracy is something which affects every one of the fourteen million people of Canada; democracy is something that is shared by every one of those fourteen million people, but in the end, so far as national activities are concerned, the ability of all those people to express themselves within the democracy is through the channels afforded here in the parliament of Canada. For that reason it has been urged by others as well as by myself that we should not, at a time like this, proceed to extend these extremely wide powers, particularly without any explanation being given as to why such vast powers are necessary at this time.
This is not a subject that is coming up for discussion today for the first time; it has been under consideration for many years by people who are concerned about the preservation of parliamentary democracy. As the members of this house well know, one of the most learned books on that subject
