Mr. H. B. McCulloch (Pictou) presented the sixth report of the standing committee on railways, canals and telegraph lines, and moved that the report be concurred in.
Motion agreed to.
In order to clarify statements
which already have been made and to answer questions asked by several hon. members with reference to television, I wish to make this brief statement.
In my statement of December 8, 1952, I mentioned six centres in which Canadian Broadcasting Corporation television stations are to be established immediately, and indicated that applications would now be received for private stations to serve other areas. I pointed out that under the plan the private stations licensed would carry national program service of the C.B.C., besides having time for programming on their own. I also said, as reported at page 409 of Hansard of December 8, 1952:
Since the objective will be to extend services as widely throughout Canada as is practicable, no two stations will be licensed at the present to serve the same area. A television station can serve only a comparatively small area. Canada is very large and it will require a good many stations before television can be brought to the people in most parts of our country. It is desirable to have one station in as many areas as possible before there are two in any one area.
These words make it clear that it was not the policy of the government to create monopoly in television or to limit any one area indefinitely to one television station.
The principle of one station to an area is to apply only until an adequate national television system is developed. At the rate that applications for stations are now being received it may not be long before there is a sufficient degree of national coverage to justify the government and the C.B.C. giving
consideration to permitting two and perhaps in some cases more than two stations in certain areas. It is anticipated that, in due course, private stations will be permitted in areas covered by C.B.C. stations, and the
C.B.C. may establish stations in some areas originally covered by private stations.
The ultimate objective of the C.B.C. is to have at least one station in every province of Canada where that is practicable. We understand that private applications have been under development in the five provinces where no C.B.C. station is now under way, and the government does not want to discourage immediate establishment in these areas of private stations which will further extend national service coverage. For that reason licences granted for private stations in those provinces will contain a provision that, before establishing a competing station, the C.B.C. will ascertain whether the area is likely to afford adequate financial support for two stations. If not, it may offer to purchase the private station at a fair and reasonable price rather than set up a new one.


In connection with that, may I ask whether the understanding is that the minister would regard an adequate national television service as having been established if there is at least one station in every province.


That is the ultimate objective, and that, along with private stations, will constitute the national coverage.


Well, am I not correct in my
understanding that the distance that one can be reasonably sure of good television broadcasting conditions is not more than fifty miles at the present time?


That is correct, as far as my knowledge goes.


That is correct, is it? With the recognition-


That is the minimum.


With the recognition of that limitation, do I gather that the minister says that one television station established in each province would be regarded as adequate television facilities across Canada?


No.


No, I did not say that. I suggest, Mr. Speaker, that probably if the
3394	HOUSE OF
Inquiries of the Ministry statement were studied any questions might be asked at a later date.


May I ask the minister a
supplementary question in view of this statement? Has attention been given to the representations that were reported to have been made that the corporations controlled by foreign capital should not have a dominating interest in stations licensed by the C.B.C.?


I am unable to answer that because my knowledge is not official; it is only what I have seen in the newspaper, and I have not yet had a report from the C.B.C. with reference to the meetings last week.


On the orders of the day:
should like to direct a question to the Minister of National Revenue arising out of his statement on television made earlier this afternoon. I understand that the corporation plans to set up stations-


The hon. member should not make a statement. I will allow him to ask his question, but he should not make his statement.


What plans has the minister for television in Newfoundland?


In the general plan ultimately the C.B.C. would like to have a station in every province.


How long is ultimately?


As long as you want to put it.


On the orders of the day:
wonder if the minister heard the announcement over the radio today that television stations were going to be set up by private organizations at Quebec city, Windsor and Sydney. Could he add to that list?


I did not hear the announcement over the radio but I am acquainted with the recommendations that are to be made by the C.B.C. to the radio division, Department of Transport.


What other cities besides Quebec city, Windsor and Sydney?


It is proposed to recommend that licences be granted for Sydney, Nova Scotia; Saint John, New Brunswick; Quebec city; Hamilton; London, Windsor and Sudbury; one in each instance.


What about Victoria?


We have no application yet, and we cannot deal with them until we get them.


Might I ask the Minister of National Revenue who secured the television licence for Sydney, Nova Scotia?


No licence has been given. According to the announcement that has been made, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation will make a recommendation to the radio division, Department of Transport, to grant a licence. Offhand I do not know who it is. I think it is the same people who have the radio station. I do not know their corporate name.





Cape Breton Broadcasters.


I should like to lay on the table copies in English and in French of a general agreement between Canada and Belgium, signed at Brussels today, concerning the transit through and the stationing in Belgium of Canadian forces. I might say that the object of this agreement is to arrange for certain small lines of communication and supply units of the 27th Canadian infantry brigade group to be stationed in Belgium in fulfilment of NATO requirements.
When arrangements have been completed with the Belgian government it is proposed that these units, which are now in Germany, will move into the Campine area near Antwerp.
(Translation):


Mr. Speaker, I believe you will find it fitting that I draw the attention of the house to the presence of the distinguished visitors who have just entered the diplomatic gallery, in company with the French ambassador, His Excellency Mr. Guerin; I refer to the President of the council of ministers of the French Republic, Mr. Rene Mayer, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Georges Bidault, and the Minister of Finance, Mr. Maurice Bourges-Maunoury.

It is important that mention be made of this visit in the official record of the House of Commons so that its readers may also be acquainted with the honour bestowed upon us this afternoon by the representatives of France, in thus attending one of our sittings.
It is important too that we say to our distinguished visitors in our capacity as representatives, in this house, of the people of the whole country, that we wish them to carry back from their short visit among us the vivid impression that all Canadians, from coast to coast, wish to carry out in an efficient and fruitful manner their co-operation with our mother countries, as well as with the other European nations, in order to defend this civilization for which we are indebted to them and of which our democratic institutions are an essential expression.
(Text):


Mr. Speaker-


Say it in
French, please.


Mr. Speaker, may I join with the Prime Minister in expressing the welcome that is in the heart of every hon. member to the distinguished representatives of France who are with us here this afternoon. To the Prime Minister and his associates may we say that under our democratic system we also have an opposition, and that opposition is part of our democratic procedure. But may I assure them, through you, sir, that in our welcome this afternoon there is certainly complete harmony, complete understanding, and only one thought, and that is to welcome them and to wish that in their high responsibilities they may guide their great nation to the destiny that we all wish it to share in these troubled years ahead. There are deep bonds of affection between our country and France that are not measured alone by the fact that France was one of the two countries from which those races which joined to make a nation came to these shores many years ago.
Then, there is the other point that is of great importance to all Canadians from every part of Canada. Hundreds of thousands of young Canadians came to know France, through the service they gave in a common cause. Many thousands of those Canadians sleep forever in French soil. The hearts of hundreds of thousands of Canadians here in Canada are forever deeply bound to the soil and people of France.
All those who have had the privilege of seeing what has happened in these past few
Welcome to French Officials years have great admiration for the magnificent work that has already been done to rebuild a nation which, for the second time in a single generation, has felt the devastation of war. The recovery of France, its physical rebuilding, and the unity of purpose which has become so apparent is of great advantage not only to France itself, but to the whole free world.
May I say to the distinguished visitors: I join the Prime Minister in the words he used when he said that it was the wish and hope of every Canadian that your cause may be advanced in every way. And I simply join with him in expressing what I know is the hope of every one of us, that the recovery and rebuilding of France may proceed to meet your highest dreams, and that in the years ahead France may take her proper place among the nations of the world in giving leadership to that ideal of civilization which is our common heritage.

2.	Nil.
Dominion coal board:
1.	(a) As far as subsidy payments for coal are concerned the following table covers amounts paid during wartime. These were mostly to protect the general cost of living and were paid to mine operators who were unable, without sustaining losses, to meet increased labour costs arising out of awards of wage increases approved by the proper authority. The item "cost of living bonus" was paid to the operators for distribution to their employees for the same general purpose.
Production subsidies	 $36,917,011
Grants for direct development of coal mines		394,302
Grants for housing of
coal miners	 14,984
Wage equalization payments 685,700 Cost of living bonus	 3,453,286

These are reported upon in the report of the royal commission on coal at pages 551-2, 556-7-8-9 and 560.
(b)	There is a subsidy paid to coal mine companies on coal sold for export or ship's stores on the west coast. The total paid to mining companies for this purpose in the years 1938-1952 was $792,907.
(c)	In addition to the amounts paid to mining companies set forth in (a) and Ob) there is the matter of payments made to the Dominion Coal Company and Old Sydney Collieries Ltd. This assistance is not paid to these mining companies as such but in their capacity as transportation agents. In other words, they have chartered ships to transport their coal. The amounts paid in this connection are:
Dominion Coal Co. Ltd	$17,967,214
Old Sydney Collieries Ltd. ..	655,326

These payments are in the same category as amounts paid to the railway companies which are fully set forth in the annual reports of the dominion coal board.
As far as this department has been able to ascertain no other subsidy or assistance payments have been made to mining companies, except payments made under the Emergency Gold Mining Assistance Act.

For a copy of all payrolls, orders or vouchers for the purchase, transportation and hauling of materials and supplies in connection with the construction and/or repair of the public wharf at Cullens Brook, Bonaventure county, Quebec, from the 1st day of October, 1952, to the 31st day of December, 1952.


For a copy of all correspondence, telegrams and other documents, exchanged between any person or persons and the Department of Public Works, or any other department of the government, from January 1, 1940 to date, relating to the construction of a public building in Port Alfred, Quebec, also a copy of all correspondence exchanged between the different departments of the government, during the same period, relative to this question.


There is no objection to passing the first part of this order of the house, but the second part reads:

These documents would be of a confidential nature.

the exception that all the words after "Port Alfred, Quebec" be struck out?


Motion agreed to.
For a copy of all correspondence, telegrams and other documents, exchanged between any person or persons and the Department of Public Works, or any other department of the government, from January 1, 1940 to date, relating to the construction of a public building in Chicoutimi, Quebec; also a copy of all correspondence exchanged between the different departments of the government, during the same period, regarding this question.

Motions for Papers


The remarks which
I made on the previous resolution would apply to this resolution.


Will the resolution carry with the exception that all the words after "Chicoutimi, Quebec" be struck out?


Motion agreed to.
For a copy of the report of the representatives of the sugar refiners on their mission to Cuba, following the announcement by the Minister of Trade and Commerce.


Mr. Speaker, there is no such report as the one requested in this motion for the production of papers; therefore I ask that it be dropped.


Dropped.


For a copy of leases granted by the Indian affairs department to individuals and companies in the province of Saskatchewan from 1945 to the present by reservations.


My colleague, the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration (Mr. Harris), being absent, I would ask the hon. member if he will allow this motion to stand.


I shall be glad to have it stand; indeed I would be glad to withdraw it for redrafting, because I am told it would involve a long list of leases. I think I can make it more specific. If that is agreeable, I would ask leave to withdraw the motion in order to redraft it.


Withdrawn.


that the house go into committee at the next sitting to consider the following resolution:
That it is expedient to introduce a measure to amend the National Defence Act in respect of certain offences committed by members of the forces out of Canada, to provide for the custody of members of the forces found guilty by civil courts in Canada or by civil or military tribunals of countries other than Canada, and to provide for the disposition of certain classes of appeals; also to amend the Defence Services Pension Act respecting the service that may be counted for purposes of the act and to make pensions payable to the widows and children of persons to whom section

46E of the act applies; and also to amend the Canadian forces voting regulations respecting the completion of statements of ordinary residence.
He said:	His Excellency the Governor
General, having been made acquainted with the subject matter of this resolution, recommends it to the consideration of the house.


Motion agreed to.
On the orders of the day:
I
should like to direct a question to the Right Hon. Minister of Agriculture. Is the government ready to make an announcement on butter prices?


Under authority of order in
council, P. C. 2023, of April 27, 1951, the agricultural prices support board was authorized to purchase first-grade creamery butter during the period May 1, 1951, to April 30, 1953. Under authority of paragraph (b) of subsection (1) of section 9 of the Agricultural Prices Support Act, 1944, the agricultural prices support board now proposes to offer to purchase from May 1, 1953, to April 30, 1955, first-grade creamery butter produced in Canada, and under authority of paragraph (a) of subsection (1) of section 9 of the said act proposes to prescribe the following prices therefor:
Fifty-eight cents per pound basis delivery Halifax, Saint John, Montreal and Toronto.
Fifty-seven cents basis delivery Vancouver.
All purchases to be subject to such terms and conditions as may be specified by the agricultural prices support board. I may say by way of explanation that four years ago we established floor prices of 58 cents basis Montreal and Toronto. Three years ago we reduced that to 53 cents. Two years ago we put it back to 58 cents and made it apply for two years instead of one. This year we are just extending the policy as it has been for the last two years for the next two years.


On the orders of the day:
I
should like to ask the acting minister of external affairs if the government has joined in the protest reported to have been made by the United States embassy to the government of Colombia because of an attack upon

the Rev. Stanley Wright, formerly of Tisdale, Saskatchewan? If so, what acknowledgment, if any, has been made of the protest?


The Canadian
ambassador took up his duties only on March 23. He has been asked to make inquiries and report. When the report is received instructions will be given to him to suit the circumstances.
(Translation):


Mr. Speaker, may I ask the Minister of National Defence (Mr. Claxton) if he is now ready to answer the question I put to him last Wednesday about the firing range at Baie-du-Febvre?


Not yet, Mr. Speaker.
(Text):


On the orders of the day:
I should like to direct a question to the Minister of Resources and Development. In view of the severe housing shortage in Saskatoon and in view of the fact that mortgage money for building is almost unobtainable, will the minister authorize Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation under section 31A of the National Housing Act to use its own funds to provide housing loans?


Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation is authorized to make loans under section 31A of the National Housing Act where such loans are not being made available by lending institutions. In 1952 there were two major lending institutions making loans under the National Housing Act in Saskatoon. One of these lending institutions intends to make about the same number of loans this year and the other lending institution is giving consideration to whether or not they will operate in Saskatoon. These circumstances are now being reviewed with the lending institutions by Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation, and it is hoped that National Housing Act loans in about the same amount as in 1952 will be available this year. It is not the policy of the government to authorize Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation
Inquiries of the Ministry to make direct loans under section 31A in areas in which the lending institutions are operating, which is the case at the present time in Saskatoon.
I might add that in 1952 there were 651 new starts in Saskatoon compared with 410 in 1951. As of January, 1952, there were 264 units under construction whereas on January 1, 1953, there were 468 units under construction, thereby ensuring a good level of completions this year.


On the orders of the day:
On
Friday last, when the supplementary estimates of the Department of Fisheries were being considered by the committee of supply, the hon. member for St. John's West asked the Minister of Fisheries when the report of the fisheries research board would be available. In reply thereto, I may say to him that at the present time the report is being printed by the queen's printer, and as soon as copies are available they will be tabled.


On the orders of the day:
I
should like to direct a question to the Minister of Transport. Is he in a position to make a statement with respect to pensions for former members of the Newfoundland railway, postal and telegraph services?


I am not in a position to make a statement because this is a matter which concerns not only the Department of Transport but other departments. It is a very complicated question and, as the hon. member knows, it is also receiving the attention of my colleague, the Secretary of State, as indicated in the letter which he was good enough to send over to me. Until such time as there is greater opportunity to consider the points at issue, I am afraid I cannot make a statement.
(Translation):


On the orders of the day:
Mr. Speaker, may I put a question to the Secre-

Customs Tariff
tary of State (Mr. Bradley)? When will his department finally decide to table the file which is the subject of a motion for papers appearing in my name and adopted by the house on January 28 last?
I had asked, at that time, for a copy of all correspondence exchanged in connection with the teaching of religion and French at Wood-falle School, Royal Canadian Air Force station, Rockcliffe, Ontario. This order appears at page 193 of the Votes and Proceedings of January 28.
(Text):


Mr. Speaker, unfortunately my knowledge of the French language is not profound enough for me to have gathered completely the purport of what my hon. friend has said, but I shall be glad to look into the matter.


the second reading of Bill No. 227, to amend the Customs Tariff.


Motion agreed to, bill read the second time and the house went into committee thereon, Mr. Jutras in the chair.
On section 1-Schedule A amended.
The explanatory note indicates that the purpose of the bill is to implement the budget resolutions relating to the Customs Tariff. I must say that, notwithstanding a very diligent review of the budget resolutions in relation to the Customs Tariff, I do not find any corresponding with the first section of the bill having to do with cigarettes. Will the parliamentary assistant to the minister favour us with an explanation of section 1 of the bill?


If the hon. member for Eglin-ton will look at the resolutions, he will see that resolution No. 2 covers section 1 exactly.


Resolution No. 2 under the Customs Tariff?


Under the Customs Tariff.


What page?


Page 6.


Can the parliamentary
assistant give us the Hansard reference?1


I do not have Hansard in front of me but I have the budget resolutions as they were distributed to all members, and I remember quite vividly that a week ago Thursday we adopted resolution 2. We dropped resolution 1 and adopted resolution 2.


I was referring to the Hansard containing the budget speech of the minister followed by the budget resolutions. On looking at these it strikes me that it may well be that a couple of the resolutions were not printed in the Hansard of April 8. If the parliamentary assistant will look at page 1262 he will find there under Customs Tariff resolution No. 1-


The budget was brought down on February 19 this year. April 8 was the date of the bringing down of the budget in 1952.


I am sorry; I have the wrong copy.


I should like to ask a question regarding the duty on cigarettes inasmuch as we are now getting certain American cigarettes that are regularly imported into Canada. I tried to get the information from the department this morning. I called the minister's office. I am told that there is a difference between the tax and duty on United States cigarettes coming into Canada and the taxes on our own cigarettes. I should like some information about that. At the same time I should like the parliamentary assistant to tell me whether the fact that a pack of twenty imported cigarettes is lighter in weight than a similar package of twenty Canadian cigarettes also enters into the picture so far as the cost to the consumer, the rate of duty and the customs tariff are concerned. The reason I would like to have an explanation is that there is an ad valorem tax. I assume it is based on value and, inasmuch as tobacco that goes into American cigarettes may be purchased at a price lower than we have to pay in Canada, that would also enter into the picture. If by any chance there is a difference in the tax it would, of course, be reflected in our growers' prices as well as the manufacturers' prices.
I hope I have made that clear.


Mr. Chairman, I am holding in my hands two tables showing the combined duties and taxes on cigarettes of various sizes imported into Canada, together with the corresponding figures for excise duties and taxes on Canadian cigarettes. The first table shows the figures before the proposed changes and the second table shows the figures after the proposed changes. If it is agreeable I would like to have these two tables placed on Hansard at this point.


Is that agreeable to the committee?


Agreed.

Customs Tariff


Does the statement cover both customs duties and excise taxes?


Yes, and I am going to explain. The table shows, for instance, that up to February 1, or February 20 in the case of the customs tariff, the customs duty on regular size cigarettes, Camels and Chesterfields for example, imported from the United States, was $2 per pound plus 15 per cent ad valorem, a total of $5.53 cents per thousand cigarettes. The customs duty of $2 per pound is the equivalent of $5 per thousand cigarettes. The ad valorem duty is the equivalent of 53 cents. Then there was an additional duty of $2 per thousand and an excise tax of 2 cents on each 5 cigarettes. If you add the sales tax of $1.10 you get a figure of $12.63 for the total aggregate customs and excise taxes on American cigarettes imported into Canada. The addition of the excise duty, excise tax and sales tax on Canadian cigarettes before the proposed changes give a figure of $10.95 which means that the difference, the protection for the Canadian cigarettes, is $1.68.
In this bill it is proposed to take off the $2 additional duty on imported cigarettes, not only American, and reduce the excise duty on Canadian cigarettes from $6 to $4. The reduction is the same in each case and, consequently, the spread will be the same- $1.68-which will remain the protection in favour of Canadian cigarettes. That means that American cigarettes cannot compete on the market any more now than they could before the proposed changes.
There is a difference with respect to king size cigarettes and that is the reason for the proposed change in the excise duty instead of the excise tax. Up to now there was no additional customs duty on imported king size cigarettes, and the combined customs duty, excise and sales taxes on imported king size cigarettes was $11.98. Because of an excise duty of $11 per thousand on Canadian-made king size cigarettes, had they been manufactured, the aggregate of such excise duties and sales taxes would have been $16.46, which would have given a spread in favour of the American or other imported cigarettes of around $4.50. Therefore, in the proposed changes in the Excise Act, which we will study in a few minutes, the duty will be dropped from $11 to $5. The protection in favour of any Canadian-made king size cigarettes from now on will be $2.12 per thousand.
I believe that all that I have said can be much more easily understood by looking at the two tables which are very clear and give every tax and duty in detail.
;Mr. Lesage.]


There is just one point which I would like to have clarified. I understand from the parliamentary assistant that $1.68 is the difference between the combined duties and taxes on Canadian cigarettes and American cigarettes. The tax on the imported cigarettes is that much greater. Is that right?


That is right.


There is the question of weight. Do you know what our ordinary cigarettes weigh per thousand? The way you have it figured there, at $5 for customs duty, that would be two and a half pounds per thousand cigarettes. However, do our cigarettes weigh more than that?


Our cigarettes weigh 2'49 pounds per thousand. Our ordinary cigarettes are about the same weight as the ordinary American cigarettes. No Canadian king size cigarettes are manufactured and I suppose that one of the reasons is that there was a combined excise duty, excise and sales tax of $16.46 per thousand. That will now be reduced to $9.86.


Do you happen to have the invoice price of American cigarettes-for instance Shirley cigarettes?


I am informed that it has been $3.55 until lately when the price increased to $3.90.


I wonder if this could not stand, because I would like to take a look at the schedule you have. It will only take me a few minutes, and I will give the copies back to you.
(Translation):


Mr. Chairman, I should like to direct a few questions to the parliamentary assistant to the Minister of Finance (Mr. Lesage). These questions have nothing to do with cigarettes but rather with a tariff item having to do with the act to amend the Customs Tariff, but which, unfortunately, does not appear among the tariff items to be amended-


Mr. Chairman, on a point of order. Could I ask that we stick, for the time being, to the question of cigarettes. I do not want to prevent the hon. member from speaking about an item which is not mentioned in the list, although we could prevent him from doing so, under the rules of the house; however it seems to me that the discussion would be very much simplified if he would only wait until we came to the next clause of the bill.


If it will suit the parliamentary assistant to the Minister of Finance better I will be happy to accept his suggestion and I will tell him immediately what interests me, as he probably has guessed- it is the tariff item that pertains to ropes used by fishermen in the fishing industry.


I think I can reply immediately. It is our intention, when we examine the bill to amend the Excise Tax Act-and I think that will come up tomorrow-to move that the sales tax be abolished on all ropes used in the fishing industry, including all those measuring one and a half inches or more in circumference.
As far as the small protection on ropes measuring more than one and a half inches is concerned, such protection is necessary, according to the information I have been given, because there is in Canada a rather important rope manufacturing industry. Therefore, although the government's policy is to make international trade as free as possible
