5.	What accounts for the difference, if any, between domestic price and export price?
6.	What percentage of amber Durum wheat grown in Canada is produced in Manitoba?
7.	What percentage of this wheat is sold to the domestic market, and to the export market?


1.	Average prices received

1952-53 Pool Account-Wheat
(a)	Under international wheat agreement- $1.824527 per bushel basis No. 1 amber Durum wheat in store Fort William/Port Arthur or Vancouver.
(b)	Outside international wheat agreement (class II)-$2.6381903 per bushel basis No. 1 amber Durum wheat in store Fort William/ Port Arthur or Vancouver.
(c)	Average of export sales-$2.3408896 per bushel basis No. 1 amber Durum wheat in store Fort William/Port Arthur or Vancouver.
2.	$2.2766075 per bushel basis No. 1 amber Durum wheat in store Fort William/Port Arthur or Vancouver, less operating and administrative costs of 4-33068 cents per bushel.
3.	The final price to producers reflected different selling bases for Durum wheat, namely, export prices under the terms of the international wheat agreement, export prices outside the international wheat agreement and domestic selling prices as provided by Canadian wheat board regulations, 1952-53 and 1953-54 and amendments thereto.
4.	$1.8296569 per bushel basis No. 1 amber Durum wheat in store Fort William/Port Arthur or Vancouver.
5.	From August 1, 1952 to September 23, 1953 Durum grades of wheat were sold on the same price basis:
(a) Under the international wheat agreement.
(b) In the domestic market.
From September 24, 1953 Durum grades of wheat were sold in the domestic market at a premium of 10 cents per bushel over the board's selling prices for Durum wheat under the international wheat agreement. Over the period of the 1952-53 pool account wheat, export prices for Durum wheat outside the international wheat agreement were substantially higher than prices quoted under the international wheat agreement.
6.	The Canadian wheat board is not aware of official estimates of production of Durum wheat in Manitoba. Production, however, is highly concentrated in the prairie provinces and in 1952-53 total board receipts of Durum grades of wheat from producers amounted to 8,288,289-8 bushels, of which 1,725,745 bushels,, or 20-822 per cent were in Manitoba.
7.	This question cannot be answered for the reason that there is no way of identifying grain produced in any province after such grain is unloaded at terminal elevators in Fort William/Port Arthur or elsewhere.

2.	If so, of what nature were such proposals?
3.	Has the government considered any possible advantages to the western provinces in the construction of this seaway?
4.	If so, what are these advantages?


1.	Yes.
2.	Several letters have been received from organizations and individuals in the western provinces and these correspondents have commended the government for acting on the St. Lawrence seaway and recommending that work be proceeded with at the earliest possible moment.
3.	It is felt that this question is answered by the statement made in the House of Commons in 1951 on December 4 by the Minister of Transport (Mr. Chevrier), as follows:
As a matter of fact it is difficult to go very far in ranking the benefits to the various provinces in order of importance. Rather than argue about which will gain the most, let us look at what concrete opportunities will be opened up for each.
The prairies would find a substantial saving in the cost of moving grain, flour and other products to

markets in eastern Canada and overseas. Moreover the seaway would permit large ocean vessels to move into the great lakes to relieve such shortages of shipping as occurred this year. Shortages occur from time to time to hinder the grain movement, for at present the only vessels that can enter the lakes are too small and too few to make much impression.
4.	Answered by No. 3.

1.	Has the government any information concerning a survey undertaken by the United States department of labor, in a number of American
cities for the purpose of ascertaining the total annual cost of a representative list of goods and services considered necessary for urban families to provide for health, efficiency, the nurture of children, and participation in social and community activities?
2.	If so, can such information be made available to parliament?
3.	Has the Canadian government undertaken a comparable survey in Canada, so as to determine the annual cost of a modest but adequate level of living, in terms of dollars, as distinct from the percentage basis of the consumer price index?
4.	If so, what are the results of such a survey?
5.	If not, is consideration being given to the making of such a survey?


1.	Yes. The bureau of labor statistics of the United States department of labor published a budget titled "The City Workers Family Budget" in the February 1948 issue of the Monthly Labour Review. This document contains the following statements:
The budget was designed to represent the estimated dollar cost required to maintain this family at a level of adequate living-to satisfy prevailing standards of what is necessary for health, efficiency, the nurture of children, and for participation in community activities.
This is not a "subsistence" budget, nor is it a "luxury" budget; it is an attempt to describe and measure a modest but adequate standard of living.
A detailed description of the budget as well as total dollar cost of purchasing it in thirty-four large United States cities at March 1946 and June 1947, was provided in the above mentioned issue of the Monthly Labour Review. This budget was last priced at October 1951 and costs of a budget in thirty-four large United States cities as of this date were published in the Monthly Labour Review of May 1952.
2.	The document described in the answer to question No. 1 is for sale by the superintendent of documents, United States government printing office, Washington 25, D.C. It may be consulted in the library of parliament. See last annual supplement to the catalogue of the library of parliament.
3.	No. The budgetary studies made by the government of Canada are restricted to determining on a factual basis the goods and services actually purchased by representative groups of Canadian families.
4.	See answer to No. 3.
5.	No. The determination of "a modest but adequate level of living" requires a series of subjective judgments on which it is extremely difficult to secure any general agreement.

On the orders of the day:
I should like to direct a question to the Minister of Labour. In view of the serious unemployment situation existing today, will the government give consideration to continuing the payment of unemployment insurance benefits to those whose unemployment insurance credits have expired and who, through no fault of their own, are unable to find work?


Mr. Speaker, consideration was given to that question before the Easter recess, and it was decided not to take that step.


On the orders of the day:
should like to direct a question to the Prime Minister. Is the government giving any consideration to support by Canada of the five-point peace plan to settle the war in Indo-China, advanced by Prime Minister Nehru at New Delhi on Friday last?


I understand that my hon. friend's question refers to the speech made in the House of the People by Prime Minister Nehru on Saturday, April 24.


It was in Friday's paper.


Then it must have been a preview because we have just received from the Canadian High Commissioner in New Delhi a summary of the statement on IndoChina made by the prime minister in the House of the People on Saturday, April 24. It is being studied very carefully by us here. We have also passed on this summary to the Secretary of State for External Affairs (Mr. Pearson), who is now leading the Canadian delegation at the Geneva conference, as the proposals of Prime Minister Nehru will no doubt be given very careful consideration by those delegations which will be participating in the discussions on Indo-China at Geneva. In view of the fact that other countries are more directly concerned than Canada with this immensely complicated situation, I do not feel I should say any more at this time.
[Later: 1


Mr. Speaker, may I ask the Prime Minister whether, in regard to the matter to which he just
Inquiries of the Ministry made reference in reply to the hon. member for Rosetown-Biggar (Mr. Coldwell), and other developments in the Indo-China theatre, reconsideration has been or will be given to the position of the Canadian delegation at the Geneva conference with a view to ensuring that we will take part as an interested and concerned party in the discussion on Indo-China?


Mr. Speaker, I would not like to commit the government to making any recommendation to parliament at this time to become directly involved in what is taking place in Indo-China. There have been statements made in this house that our obligations which might involve military action in the East were limited to what we were doing under the aegis of the United Nations. Now, there might arise a situation where it would be felt that we should go beyond that, but the government will have to give that very serious consideration. Before definitely committing Canada to action which might involve the participation of military forces, the government will, however, certainly bring its recommendation to parliament.


I think the Prime Minister has misunderstood my question. My question was whether in view of these developments the Canadian delegation to the Geneva conference would be taking part in the discussion on Indo-China as an interested party; not whether the government of Canada was going to make any commitment with respect to the conflict there. The basis of my question was that the Secretary of State for External Affairs (Mr. Pearson) in the external affairs debate some three weeks ago indicated we probably would not be taking part in that conference on Indo-China because we were not immediately concerned. My question relates to whether in view of the new developments we can any longer continue to take the position that we are not concerned in what goes on there.


Canada has never taken the position that it was not concerned. It has taken the position that it was not directly participating in what was taking place in Indo-China and, as a consequence, that it had no standing to participate in decisions which might be made with respect to military action in Indo-China. We wish to fully discharge the spirit of the statements made to the house, that we are not going to involve Canada in matters that might require military action for their implementation without making a full disclosure to this house and a recommendation as a consequence of that disclosure.

Inquiries of the Ministry WATER POLLUTION


On the orders of the day:
Mr. Speaker, I should like to direct a question to the Prime Minister. Has the Prime Minister received a request from any provincial premier for a western provincial conference with the federal government to discuss the pollution of the North Saskatchewan river? If so, when will such a conference be held?


Mr. Speaker, no letter has been received from any provincial premier requesting a provincial-federal meeting to consider the pollution of the North Saskatchewan river. The premier of Saskatchewan did forward, or at least we received three copies of certain resolutions adopted by the legislative assembly of Saskatchewan in which it was requested:
That this assembly urges the government of Canada to take cognizance of the health hazard and inconvenience which Saskatchewan citizens living along the course of the North Saskatchewan river have suffered as a result of the pollution of this stream . . .
That is all we have received in that connection.


On the orders of the day:
Mr. Speaker, may I ask the Minister of Trade and Commerce if negotiations are proceeding in any form between the government of Canada and the United States with respect to the possible limitation of export by Canada of base metals to the United States; if so, what stage these negotiations have reached and what position the Canadian government is taking?


Mr. Speaker, there are no such negotiations current at the present time.


On the orders of the day:
Mr. Speaker, I would like to direct a question to the Minister of Trade and Commerce. Does the minister intend to raise the price of wheat by seven cents a bushel at the head of the lakes, as he indicated he would do when lake shipping was resumed this spring?


Mr. Speaker, the Minister of Trade and Commerce does not set the price of wheat. That is the function of the wheat board. However, it might interest my hon. friend to know that the price of wheat at Fort William has advanced by four cents a bushel over the last two or three weeks.


On the orders of the day:
Mr. Speaker, I have a question for the Minister of Finance (Mr. Abbott) which he might like to take as notice if he does not have the information immediately available. Can the minister tell the house what change in the civil servants' superannuation regulations makes it necessary to conduct a survey of retired civil servants, demanding information on any employment they may have, their rates of pay, and their periods of employment?


Mr. Speaker, my hon. friend was good enough to send notice of this question to my office, but I received it just before entering the house. I will take this as notice and attempt to give an answer tomorrow.


that the house go into committee of supply.


Mr. Speaker, I propose to avail myself of the opportunity presented by this motion to deal with a subject which was mentioned earlier, and which has received fresh emphasis since we met here just under two weeks ago.
Within that time there have been a number of statements and events which have impressed the necessity for some definite steps being taken to bring together at the earliest possible date the government of Canada and the governments of the provinces in order to deal with these matters which are causing concern, not only to the members of the different legislative bodies, but to the people of Canada generally.
As an example of the kind of statement to which I refer, there was a speech made by the minister charged with the responsibility for civil defence in which he dealt with the

changing picture which has been presented to us as a result of the hydrogen bomb. He pointed out that with the enormously increased destructive power of this bomb we must review our attitude to the whole problem of civil defence.
I am referring to the speech made by the Minister of National Health and Welfare (Mr. Martin) at Windsor on April 23. Having reviewed the new situation resulting from the terrible power of this bomb, the minister had this to say, as reported in a dispatch in the Windsor Star of April 24:
It is no longer possible, he said, to indulge in the idle luxury of debating whether this civil defence job is a federal, provincial or local responsibility.
The size of the possible threat is much too great for that; it is so large that it clearly and inevitably involves us all.
I do not think that there will be much tendency on the part of any 'non. member in this house to disagree with the fact that this is a problem which involves us all. This is a subject which is of primary importance in the minds of people throughout the world who hope that there may be some possibility of peace through the joint efforts of the freedom-loving nations. Having said that, may I point out, however, that it is one thing to emphasize the seriousness of this situation and it is another thing to leave the impression that there is any less reason to discuss where the responsibility lies.
Let it be granted that every one of us must be prepared to consider this subject and to join in every way we can in preparing to meet the threat which is of a nature that we do not care to contemplate but which could be a dreadful reality. It had been pointed out by municipality after municipality across Canada that their burdens were already so heavy that they could not meet the financial responsibilities involved in some aspects of civil defence. If this problem has suddenly increased both in scale and in importance, that fact is all the more reason why there must be some understanding as to how this plan of civil defence is to be carried out, how the reassessed responsibilities are to be borne and how the financing of those responsibilities is to be accepted by the different bodies charged with the responsibility of finding the money necessary for that purpose. This is one of those problems which have remained unsolved because of the failure of the government of Canada to continue those conferences which might have found a solution of our difficulties along those lines.
Then let me refer to something else that, within this past week, has emphasized the problems that we face. Last week was education week. In different parts of Canada the
26, 1954	4107
Suggested Dominion-Provincial Conference cost of education and the problem related to the financing of education at the municipal level was being considered by those who have the responsibility of dealing with that subject. From many parts of Canada came requests for direct assistance by the government of Canada in a field which, under our constitution, is exclusively within the jurisdiction of the provincial governments. Surely that fact in itself emphasizes the growing complexity of this problem. Furthermore, within the time since we last met, from a number of municipalities have come recommendations that assistance in different forms be given to the municipalities directly from the government of Canada because of the inability of those municipalities to meet certain of their obligations without still further burdening the homes and the real estate within those municipalities.
These things have impressed on the minds of all of us the fact that there is not today a satisfactory understanding of this problem or anything approaching a solution of something that has been discussed on so many occasions in the past. Before we adjourned for the Easter recess I expressed the hope that the Prime Minister (Mr. St. Laurent) would extend to the provinces an invitation to attend a conference where these problems could be discussed. The Prime Minister has made no reference to that suggestion. We now meet again, and on this first day that we meet I refer again to this subject and I mention only some of the pressing demands which suggest the need for bringing together the governments within this country in order to discuss ways and means of solving those problems which are much in the minds of every one of us.
Mr. Speaker, I sought to emphasize the fact that this is not a subject which is causing concern in Canada alone. I pointed out that in Australia, under another federal constitution although a slightly different one, discussion is taking place on this same subject with an increasing sense of urgency. We also find in the United States discussions of the same subject. Mr. Speaker, under our constitutional system, this is something as to which the Prime Minister is called upon to act. If there is to be a conference, then it must be the responsibility of the Prime Minister to decide that this conference will take place. I sought to emphasize previously that this is a problem which can cause misunderstanding as well as considerable difficulties in many fields unless it is tackled and dealt with in the manner that was suggested by this government itself some years ago. After all, the war years left in this country- as in other countries-problems which were
4108	HOUSE OF
Suggested Dominion-Provincial Conference the inevitable consequence of great changes in the pressure upon governments for immediate and prompt action. When in 1942 the provincial governments agreed to certain proposals that were then made, they did so recognizing that the urgent demands of war called for some measure of joint action which would avoid any delays that might embarrass the government of Canada in accepting its international obligations at that time. There were differences of opinion in those days. Generally, however, the situation was accepted as one of the necessities of world war. The same situation developed in large measure in the United States, Australia and other countries where a federal system has been established.
I recognize that it is not appropriate at this time to discuss the details that are set forth in the budget or in any way to parallel that discussion or invade the field of the budget debate. However, I do want to point out something that apparently needs to be pointed out in view of certain comments I have seen.
I pointed out on ah earlier occasion that the request for a conference of this nature, which has been asked for, I believe, by every province in Canada either in the form of letter, statements in the legislature or by requests by the premiers of the provinces, does not in any way suggest that our position has changed with regard to any of those details which may be related to the problems that have arisen, largely as a result of the failure to have such a conference.
May I say without any reservation that our position has not changed in any way with respect to the rights of the provinces in the field of taxation, with respect to the right of the provinces to determine their own course and with respect to the rights of the provinces voluntarily to enter into agreements or not to enter into agreements as the case may be. I certainly wish it clearly understood that in again emphasizing the need for such a conference I am not in any way changing the position which has been stated emphatically over and over again, that any province which does not enter into an agreement to abandon its traditional field of taxation has a perfect right to tax in that field and should be able to do so with the kind of co-operation it received from the government of Canada in earlier days when taxes levied by the provinces were, in the case of several provinces, collected by the federal authorities.


Order. May I be permitted to interrupt the Leader of the Opposition? I do so because a moment ago he indicated that it was his understanding that this debate today on a motion to go into supply should not parallel the debate on the motion to go into 

ways and means already on the order paper. I was happy to hear him say that was his understanding because he will probably recall that on the motion to go into ways and means the hon. member for Greenwood moved an amendment the other day, paragraph (f) of which reads as follows:
(f) has failed to reach agreement with the provincial governments in regard to a clearly defined reallocation of taxing powers so that the provincial governments and municipal councils may have adequate financial resources to carry out their rapidly-increasing responsibilities.
I have been listening intently to the Leader of the Opposition ever since he began his remarks and it struck me that whatever he had to say about the responsibilities of either municipalities or provincial governments with respect to civil defence could have been fully discussed under this amendment which, I think, covers the ground that he himself covered in his speech today. The minute he left the subject of civil defence he went into the question of the taxing powers of the provincial governments and their need for additional revenue and, if I recall correctly, his suggestion as to a dominion-provincial conference was made when he was discussing the motion to go into ways and means prior to which this amendment was moved.
I merely ask for clarification at this moment. It is also my understanding that during this debate we should not parallel a debate of which notice has been given and which is supposed to be resumed within a reasonable time. I am reminded at this time of citation 246 of Beauchesne, third edition, which reads as follows:
Besides the prohibitions contained in standing order 41, it has been sanctioned by usage both in England and in Canada, that a member, while speaking, must not: . . .
(d) anticipate discussion on a motion set down for future consideration.
I know that the Leader of the Opposition does not want to duplicate a debate. It is a wholesome restraint upon members that they should not debate now a question which they can debate on a motion already on the order paper. I would be glad to hear him explain the position he takes with respect to what I have said.


Mr. Speaker-


I rise on a point of order. .


I have asked that a point of order be clarified and the Leader of the Opposition is entitled to explain his position.


I will explain as briefly as I can the reason for presenting the remarks I have and the reason why I believe they are appropriate under the circumstances. I availed myself before adjournment of the very wide

latitude afforded by the budget debate to make a request which was not directly related to any point in the amendment. I indicated at that time that I did not propose to discuss the budget but that I would do so on a later occasion. I then expressed the hope that the Prime Minister would meet an increasingly difficult situation by announcing that a conference, long overdue, would be called. I have today sought to indicate why I believe that is more urgent than ever. In doing so, I sought to mention one or two subjects that in my opinion did suggest increasing urgency in relation to that matter.
The remarks I was making at the time Your Honour rose related to certain suggestions that were made, in spite of my very clear statement that I was merely making a request for a conference and not discussing the budget at that time, that this meant a change in attitude with regard to certain fiscal problems. I am simply stating this is not the case, that I was confining my remarks at that time to the need for a conference. I have sought today to express my belief that a conference is necessary. I have sought to emphasize the way in which certain recent events and statements support that claim and, Mr. Speaker, I have made the remarks that I had proposed to make in that respect. Therefore I will present the motion I had intended to move which will indicate to you what my purpose was. I move, seconded by the hon. member for Eglinton (Mr. Fleming):
That all the words after "That" to the end of the question be deleted and the following substituted therefor:
"in the opinion of this house immediate consideration should be given to the extension of an invitation by the Prime Minister of Canada to the premiers of the provinces to a conference which would resume discussion of those matters being considered by the constitutional conference which adjourned on the 28th of September, 1950, and such other matters as now require joint consideration by all the governments of Canada."


I am
not sure what interpretation to put upon this amendment. It seems to me that if it simply criticizes the government for having failed to reconvene the conference which adjourned on September 28, 1950, it is of course in line with some criticisms I made myself during the budget debate. But as I understand the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Drew), he was discussing one phase of dominion-provincial relations which is not directly involved in the constitutional discussions that he suggests should have been carried on during the past few years, that is to say, civil defence.
It seems to me that this is a very broad amendment.
26, 1954	4109
Suggested Dominion-Provincial Conference


I do not want to interrupt the hon. member, but perhaps I might be of assistance by saying I had hoped I had made it clear it was the financial consequences of civil defence I was discussing, and the need for dealing with that problem, not in any way the problem of civil defence as such.


If we are discussing the
financial problems connected with civil defence, this resolution, it seems to me, goes far 'beyond that, and cannot be related to the conference which adjourned on September 28, 1950, because my recollection is that when I raised this subject during the budget debate and began to criticize the government on the ground that the conference should have been reconvened at an earlier date because some financial matters needed to be discussed, I was told that the conference on constitutional matters was not intended to deal with the financial relationships of the provinces and the dominion. I accepted that because I recognized immediately that that interpretation was correct.
If, however, we are discussing civil defence there is quite a lot I should like to say about it. The dangers of the hydrogen bomb, which have been revived this afternoon, were brought to the attention of this house two or three weeks ago, not only by me but in a very able and forceful speech by the hon. m
