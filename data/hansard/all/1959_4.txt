Mr. Speaker, I rise on a question of privilege, and I do so at the earliest possible opportunity. This matter of privilege concerns certain statements attributed to the Leader of the Opposition in the Ottawa Citizen of February 1 under the by-line of J. A. Hume, Citizen staff writer. If the Leader of the Opposition did say these words they constitute a frightful insult to members on this side of the house. These are the remarks attributed to him and which refer to members on this side:
-it is the cold gray dawn after their electoral debauch.
Mr. Speaker, I think even an ordinary knowledge of the English language is sufficient to indicate that the word "debauch" denotes moral turpitude of some kind, and usually gross moral turpitude. As I said before, this is a frightful insult to the members on this side of the house. If the Leader of the Opposition wishes to remain in his seat, Mr. Speaker, I suggest that he should make an immediate and full apology.


Mr. Speaker, speaking on the question of privilege I should like to assure the hon. gentleman at once that I did not have moral turpitude in mind. I had in mind only political turpitude.

3, 1958 which indicate that on the day the report was tabled the hon. member for Huron (Mr. Cardiff) moved that the report be concurred in and the motion was agreed to.
And that has been the invariable practice.


I have not had an opportunity of checking the practice but I recall last year, when this was done, not taking exception to the procedure because I thought it was a new whip who was not familiar with the practice. My recollection is, although I may be wrong in this-

Legere
Mr. Pallet! moved that the report be concurred in.
Is it the pleasure of the house to adopt the motion?


No, Mr. Speaker. The report has not been printed. Let us follow the usual practice; let the hon. member move concurrence tomorrow in the usual way.
Mr. Pallet!: Mr. Speaker, I happen to have in my hand Votes and Proceedings of June


The hon. member is wrong.


-and I think the house leader will support me in this matter-that the practice was to have the motion stand; that is to have the report presented one day and to have the names stand over until the next day until the members of the house have an opportunity of seeing them, and then immediately moving concurrence.


My understanding of the practice has been that the representatives of the different parties submit the names, and that has been done in this case. The hon. member's party has submitted names. These names have been put on the respective committees in accordance with the wishes of the leader of the official opposition. I do not suppose there is any particular objection to allowing the motion made by the government whip to stand until tomorrow. However, I would point out that every courtesy has been extended, and I think there was agreement among the three parties as to these names.


May I ask
the house leader, Mr. Speaker, whether as a matter of courtesy he will not allow the matter to stand over until tomorrow.


There is no objection to that procedure, Mr. Speaker.


The Clerk informs me that the usual practice has been to make the motion immediately, but it would seem to be a better practice to give hon. members of the house a chance to read the list before they are asked to approve the report. With the concurrence of all hon. members can the motion stand until tomorrow?


Agreed.
Motion stands.
[Mr. Pallett.l


That the standing committees of this house shall severally be empowered to examine and inquire into all such matters and things as may be referred to them by the house, and to report from time to time their observations and opinions thereon, with power to send for persons, papers and records.


Motion agreed to.
Mr. Speaker, I should like to make a brief statement with reference to the report on old age security which Dr. Robert Clark of the University of British Columbia is preparing, which report he had hoped to have completed by to-day. I was in touch by telephone with Dr. Clark this morning. He advises me that he has completed and sent forward 18 of the 20 chapters of his report, and that he has the last two chapters in the final stages of revision. He expects to have these chapters completed by the end of this present week.
In view of the widespread interest in the document I am arranging, as soon as the full text is received, to have it reproduced in sufficient quantities to meet the requirements of parliament, the press and other interested parties. This may take a little time, but I can assure hon. members that we will arrange to complete the work of reproduction as quickly as possible, and will table the document in the house and make ^^^ttional copies available to all who are interested at the earliest possible moment.


Mr. Speaker, perhaps I may be allowed to comment on the statement made by the minister. He will remember that on Thursday last I asked him when we could expect this report to be tabled, and he directed me, quite properly, to a reply that was made on the second day of the session by the Prime Minister. This reply was to the effect that he hoped to be able to table the report on February 9. Now we are advised that Dr. Clark is not able to give the minister and the house the full report.
The minister, I am sure, feels somewhat embarrassed by this situation, because it will be recalled that when the Prime Minister announced last January that he had assigned to Professor Huson the writing of this report, he indicated that he hoped to have it completed in not more than four 66968-9-514
Old Age Security months. When Professor Huson indicated that he could not possibly have the report ready in four months, which was a period that coincided with important electoral events, the Prime Minister then discharged- or perhaps the word discharged is too strong, but he asked that Professor Huson be released from his obligation and it was then assigned to Dr. Clark, for whom I have very high regard.
The minister now tells us that the report is not ready. Some of it is ready, so perhaps the minister will give consideration to releasing part of it, at any rate, in serial form. It might have very great interest, and there are some good precedents for that because one of the reports of the government's own appointed royal commission on energy has been released on an instalment basis, if that report could be released in serial form, surely a report of this importance could receive similar treatment. I hope the minister will find it possible to give some consideration to this suggestion.
Then perhaps when he deals with the matter the next time he might tell the house whether he is not really convinced that much of this work, if not all of it, could have been disposed of within a week by his own able officials in the Department of National Health and Welfare.


Mr. SDeaker, I do not think this is the type of report which it would be reasonable to table in portions. It concerns a complete study of the old age security system in the United States-insurance and survivors, I believe it is called.
I think due to the imminence of the tabling of the complete report it would be somewhat unnecessary even to consider tabling part of it at this time.


for leave to introduce Bill No. C-23, respecting navigation and salmon fishery on the Fraser river.


Explain.


This bill is simply designed to protect navigation and the salmon fishery on the Fraser river, British Columbia.
Motion agreed to and bill read the first time.

Motions for Papers INDIAN ACT


On the order:	Government notices of
motions:
February 5-The Minister of Citizenship and Immigration-The following proposed motions-
That a joint committee of the Senate and House of Commons be appointed to examine and consider the Indian Act, Chapter 149, R.S.C.,	1952, and
amendments thereto, and to suggest such amendments as they may deem advisable, with authority to investigate and report upon Indian administration in general and, in particular, on the social and economic status of the Indians;
That 24 members of the House of Commons, to be designated at a later date, act on behalf of the house as members of the said committee, and that standing order 67(1) of the House of Commons be suspended in relation thereto;
That the said committee have power to call for persons, papers and records and examine witnesses under oath; to sit while the house is sitting, and to report from time to time; and to print such papers and evidence from day to day as may be ordered by the committee and that standing order 66 be suspended in relation thereto;
And that a message be sent to the Senate requesting that house to unite with this house for the above purpose, and to select, if the Senate deems advisable, some of its members to act on the proposed joint committee.
Stand.
Hon. Sidney E. Smith (Secretary of State
for External Affairs): Mr. Speaker, I must inform the house that there are no papers which could be produced in accordance with the terms of this motion. Concultations have, of course, been held by Canadian and United States officials over the past few years with the object of determining how pilotage matters in the waters of the great lakes basin can be dealt with most satisfactorily. In the course of these discussions, which are of a continuing nature, working papers have been prepared and subjected to joint examination. No documents or correspondence on pilotage have, however, passed between the two governments subsequent to the Canadian aide memoire of March 20, 1958, a copy of which was tabled in the house on June 24 last.
Since there are no relevant papers, I suggest that the hon. member might allow this motion to drop.


Is it agreed that this motion be dropped subject to consent of the house?


Agreed.
Motion dropped.


Pursuant to section 2 of standing order 21 this government notice of motion stands transferred to and ordered for consideration under government orders at the next sitting of the house.


that the house go into committee at the next sitting to consider the following resolution, which has been recommended to the house by His Excellency:
That it is expedient to introduce a measure to amend the Federal-Provincial Tax-Sharing Arrangements Act to extend for a further period of one year the rate of 13 per cent for standard individual income tax for the purpose of calculating the tax equalization payments to the provinces and the amounts payable to the provinces under the tax rental agreements.


Motion agreed to.
Motion No. 16-Mr. Fisher:
For a copy of all correspondence, telegrams, and other documents exchanged between government departments, including the VLA administration, and persons, associations, and authorities involved in expropriation proceedings by the crown in connection with the extension of Malton airport, since June 10, 1957.
Mr. Speaker, I have discussed this matter with the hon. member for Port Arthur, and since it deals with a question which is now before the courts the hon. member is, I believe, willing to let the motion drop.


Is it agreeable that this motion be dropped in view of the explanation made by the minister?


Agreed.
Motion dropped.


Motion No. 7-Mr. Fisher:
For a copy of all correspondence and other documents exchanged between the federal government and officials of the United States concerning pilotage and the regulation of pilotage on the St. Lawrence-great lakes waterway, since June 1, 1958.
[Mr. McPhillips.l
Motion No. 35-Mr. Hardie:
For a copy of all correspondence and other documents exchanged between the federal government, or any of its departments, and air line companies, since September 1, 1957, concerning the use of Frobisher Bay as a refueling stop on their international routes.
Motion agreed to.
Motion No. 36-Mr. Hardie:
For a copy of all correspondence exchanged between the federal government, or any of its departments, and the Consolidated Mining and Smelting Company, Canadian Pacific Railway and Canadian National Railways, since January 1, 1957, concerning the building of a railway from Alberta to the south shore of Great Slave lake?
He said: Mr. Speaker, since putting this motion on the order paper I have spoken to the Minister of Transport, who has informed me that discussions are still going on with the railways. For this reason I have agreed with the minister to drop the motion at this time, but I reserve the right to place a similar motion on the order paper at a later date.
Motion dropped.
Motion No. 38-Mr. Argue:
For a copy of all correspondence, telegrams and other documents exchanged between the federal government and each of the provincial governments since March 31, 1958, regarding a bill of rights.
Mr. Speaker, this is agreeable subject to the customary exceptions and reservations.


Subject to the limitations expressed by the Prime Minister is it the pleasure of the house to adopt the motion?


Motion agreed to.
On the orders of the day:
Mr. Speaker, I should like to ask a question of the Prime Minister arising out of the reported decision of the Canadian Pacific Railway to discontinue as of February 25 winter steamship connections with the mainland from Vancouver island out of Victoria. I should like to ask the Prime Minister what steps are being taken by the government to maintain this essential service.


Mr. Speaker, that question will be answered by the Minister of Transport.


Mr. Speaker, I have been asked questions about this matter by the hon. member for Victoria, the hon. member for Nanaimo and the Minister of National Defence. I have been in touch with senior officials of the C.P.R.
Inquiries of the Ministry in this connection, and they have informed me that winter traffic has been exceedingly low, running for example, upon occasion, to only one automobile and only half as many passengers as crew on certain trips. Moreover they have advised that the two vessels involved are close to the expiry date of their safety certificates, and the company is facing heavy refit and modernization costs if the ships are continued in service. Accordingly, decision has been taken to suspend winter operations although summer service will be reinstated with other ships during the tourist season.
The company has also informed me that to accommodate traffic to Victoria special arrangements have been made with Vancouver Island Bus Lines to have connecting bus service at Nanaimo to meet the company ferries there, and that this will provide a faster over-ail transit time from Vancouver to Victoria than the direct Vancouver to Victoria ferry has given. Similarly, it is understood that the Washington State Ferries are starting a service from Anacortes to Sidney on February 26 with connecting bus services at each end, which will also provide a faster transit time from Victoria to Seattle than the ferry has hitherto given. Moreover, the provincial government of British Columbia has, I understand, announced that it proposes to go into the ferry service to serve this part of the island, and that it is building two new ferries for this purpose.
Doubtless all the foregoing factors have played their part in the decision of the Canadian Pacific to withdraw the present ships from service.
While I would not wish this to be taken as a final and categorical statement on my part regarding the legal position, I have not been able to find anything to the effect that provision of this service is a constitutional or legal responsibility of the federal government.
There is nothing further that I can say on the matter at the present time, though we will continue to give it our active consideration.


Mr. Speaker, may I ask the minister a supplementary question. Having regard to the arrangements that have been made is it not a fact that the Vancouver Island Bus Lines is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the C.P.R.?


I am not aware of that fact.


Can
the minister advise the house whether or not there is any statutory or contractual obligation on the part of the federal government to provide a ferry service between Victoria and the mainland?

Inquiries of the Ministry


Mr. Speaker, as I said in my statement I am not aware whether that is a fact. We have tried to ascertain if there is any, but have not been able to find that there is any such obligation. However, as the hon. member will have noticed in listening to my statement, the C.P.R., by providing bus service from Victoria to Nanaimo and ferry service from Nanaimo to Vancouver, is providing a faster over-all service in this manner than previously was the case with the ferry service direct from Victoria to Vancouver.


May I ask a further supplementary question. I understood the minister to say that he had received information from the steamship company that alterations and modernization work are required. If that is the reason why they cannot maintain winter service, will the minister make a further investigation as to how they intend to operate a summer service with the same boats?


If the hon. member had paid attention to what I said he would know the answer. I said that the summer service will be reinstated with other ships during the tourist season. Perhaps if the hon. member would pay more attention to what is being said rather than thinking up supplementary questions he would know what is going on.


May I ask a supplementary question. I should like to ask the minister whether his favourite, the C.P.R., only has to provide transportation when they can make money on the deal?


May I ask the minister a supplementary question. Was there consultation between the federal government on the one hand and the provincial government of British Columbia or the Canadian Pacific Railway on the other hand before this decision was taken by the railway?


No, Mr. Speaker.


I should like to ask the minister whether or not any application has been received by him or the government from the C.P.R. for a subsidy in order to maintain the service.


No, Mr. Speaker.


If so, would this be considered?


That is a hypothetical question, Mr. Speaker.


May I also be permitted to ask a supplementary question. In view of the fact that it is the policy of the minister's department to build ferries and in certain instances to turn them over to private initiative for operation, will the minister give consideration to that policy in respect of the service he has mentioned?
[Mr. Mcllraith.l


I think all hon. members will agree from what I have said that good service is going to be provided by the present arrangement. A bus service is being provided to Nanaimo and then the ferry service from Nanaimo to Vancouver, which will mean a shorter over-all elapsed time for the trip-


Who said so?


-than is available at present to passengers. That is the statement of the Canadian Pacific Railway.


I will challenge that statement anytime.


The minister did not answer my question.


If the hon. member for Laurier wants a further answer to his question, as I have said there will be a shorter elapsed time under the present arrangement than under the former.


That is not so and you know it.


Other boats will be provided
during the tourist season. The provincial government of British Columbia is going into the ferry business in the very near future. Therefore I do not think it would be a very good business venture for the federal government to try to step in in any way at all at the present time.


Will the minister give consideration to the suggestion?


Mr. Speaker, the federal government always gives consideration to any sensible suggestion.


On the orders of the day:
Mr. Speaker, I should like to direct a question to the Postmaster General, a copy of which I have sent him. In view of the good work done by the Girl Guides Association, especially in Canada, has the minister given consideration to commemorating by a special postage stamp the sixtieth anniversary of guiding in Canada next year, 1960?


During the course of a year, Mr. Speaker, we receive many suggestions for just such commemorative postal stamps. Therefore we make no decision as to the subjects for the succeeding year until fairly well along in the year which precedes the issue of the stamps. Thus it is impossible to answer this question at this

time, although certainly the Girl Guides Association and their representations in this respect will receive very serious consideration.


On the orders of the day:
wonder if I might direct a question to the Minister of National Defence. I am sorry I did not give him notice. My question relates to a very short announcement in a Canadian Press dispatch to the effect that 800 army beds and blankets were being made available to unemployed persons in the Vancouver area. Will the minister inform the house whether these beds and bedding will be made available only to unemployed transients, or might they be made available to others who may be temporarily unemployed in the Vancouver area?


You should direct that question to the Minister of Labour, because he says there is no unemployment.


Bedding and other equipment which is urgently required in a province is only made available at the request of the provincial government. The government of British Columbia has applied for the use of this equipment.


May I ask a supplementary question, Mr. Speaker. Can the minister say who might be responsible for the cleaning, repair and transportation of the beds?


The provincial government of British Columbia.


On the orders of the day:
Can the
Minister of Labour tell the house whether a settlement in the dispute between the C.B.C. and the producers has been reached? If not, what is the present position of negotiations?


No, Mr. Speaker.


May I direct the question, in that case, to the Minister of National Revenue?


So far as I know,
Mr. Speaker, no settlement has yet been reached, and I do not want to indulge in
Inquiries of the Ministry prophecy with respect to this matter. I had thought on Friday that a settlement would be reached within the matter of an hour or so, but various other problems were raised and a decision was delayed. As the hon. member and the house well know from press reports, the parties representing the producers and the corporation have been meeting almost daily. On Friday night they met until after midnight, Saturday night until after midnight, and I believe again on Sunday. They met again this morning at 11 o'clock.
My advice is that progress is being made and that the negotiations are being carried on in an atmosphere which would suggest the possibility, if not the probability, of arriving at a settlement. As soon as I have word of it I shall inform the house as to the result.


On the orders of the day:
As
I aim to serve all my constituents, regardless of party affiliation, I should like to direct a question to the Minister of Public Works prompted by some of his political friends in my constituency. Will the minister inform the house if reports are correct to the effect that owing to impossible snow conditions, all work on the Rogers pass section of the trans-Canada highway has been suspended? In view of the unusual construction difficulties and winter weather conditions experienced in this section of the trans-Canada highway, has the government given consideration to the necessity for an alternative all-weather route through the Jumbo pass?


I am afraid I cannot give much comfort to my good friend the hon. member for Kootenay West or my own political friends in that riding. As the hon. member knows, he and I conducted a campaign in the house some years ago in favour of Jumbo pass. However, we lost out and the road is now being built through Rogers pass. A great deal of money has been spent, and while work is now shut down, this is only because of the winter and there will be a resumption just as soon as the contractors are able to go to work in the spring.


On the orders of the day:
I should like to ask the Secretary of State for External Affairs whether or not

Inquiries of the Ministry a draft western reply to the recent Soviet proposals for a German settlement has been discussed with the Canadian government, and can the minister make a statement about the government's position on this particular matter?


I thank the Leader
of the Opposition for notice of his intention to address this question to me. I am able to inform the house that consultation has already commenced in the NATO council on the replies to be sent to the Soviet union in response to its notes of January 10, 1959 on the German question. When this process of consultation has been completed I hope to be able to inform the house of the position of the Canadian government on this matter.
It would seem to me that it would be helpful if I took this opportunity of tabling the text of the note sent to the Canadian government by the Soviet government on January 10, 1959, and also a copy of the draft peace treaty with Germany which accompanied that note. The main proposal in this note was that a conference be held to consider a peace treaty with Germany, and it was suggested that both parts of Germany participate in this process.
The note to the Canadian government was similar to the notes submitted to the United States, the United Kingdom and France, the powers with occupation responsibilities, as well as to a number of other countries identified by the Soviet union as those which had taken part in the second world war. I table the note and the copy of the draft treaty.


On the orders of the day:
Will the
Secretary of State for External Affairs say whether the United Kingdom government is seeking to amend the air agreement with Canada in order to obtain for B.O.A.C. fifth freedom rights at Montreal and Toronto?


As this matter comes more directly
under my jurisdiction, I shall answer the question. There have been discussions during the past year and a half between the Canadian government and the United Kingdom government regarding this air agreement. These discussions are still going on. There have not been any applications by the British government for fifth freedom rights at either Toronto or Montreal.


Will the minister allow me
to ask a supplementary question. Will he give consideration to the fact that if these fifth freedom rights were granted at Montreal and Toronto, it would mean a very severe blow to Dorval as an international airport?


I agree with the hon. member
that it would. As I say, I am glad to be able to reassure him that such fifth freedom rights have not been applied for by the British government.


On the orders of the day:
On Thursday last the hon. member for Gloucester asked me the following question:
Can the Prime Minister advise the house whether the Borden commission on energy has resumed sittings in the Atlantic provinces and, if not, when such sittings are expected to be resumed?
As already advised, the second report of the commission dealing with oil marketing will probably not be ready until April or May. The commission informs me it does not plan to hold any further public hearings until after this second report, dealing with another phase of the matters to be investigated by it, has been submitted to the government. Thereafter, public hearings will be resumed as soon as practicable, and when such hearings are resumed later in the year the commission intends to hold public hearings in the Atlantic provinces.


On the orders of the day:
Has the
Minister of Transport received a telegram from Murray A. Lowe, secretary treasurer of the industrial union of marine and shipbuilding workers of Canada, pointing out that approximately 300 employees have been laid off at the Halifax shipyard since December? Will the minister say what consideration the government is giving to the request that is made that the award of the Belle Isle ferry contract be made to the Halifax shipyard, and the request that other government work be provided for that shipyard?


I have not received such a telegram. I should like to inform the hon. member that such contracts are awarded on the basis of the lowest tender.


On the orders of the day:
I should like to direct a question to the Minister of Trade and Commerce. In view of the minister's announcement in the house on Friday last that the increase in price would apply only to wheat for shipment from the lakehead and not to wheat for shipment from the Atlantic coast ports, would the minister give assurance that maritime domestic consumers shall not have to pay higher prices for western grain, particularly for feed?


Mr. Speaker, I should like to take the question as notice, in order to give me an opportunity to consult with the wheat board.


On the orders of the day:
On Friday, Mr. Speaker, a somewhat related question was asked by the hon. member for Port Arthur, which I took as notice. He asked me the following question:
Did the wheat board take cognizance of the tentative seaway tolls on lake shipping in setting this price increase? If so, is an adjustment in the price increase either up or down possible if the tentative tolls schedule is changed?
As I indicated in my statement, the increase represented the board's preliminary estimate of the gross saving in freight likely to be realized. This, of course, would take into consideration the question of tolls. Generally speaking the board's policy is flexible, and they will be guided by experience as to its future determination and make adjustments as necessary.


I should like to ask a supplementary question of the minister. Was not the statement made by the minister the other day one that did not take into consideration, as it should not have, the question of tolls on the seaway?


What was the question?


The statement was made irrespective of tolls on the seaway, was it not?


I presume that is correct, but the question asked by the hon. member for Port Arthur is related to changes that might take place in those tolls. I presume the
Inquiries of the Ministry board, as it does with all other transportation charges, would relate that to its current business and current prices.


On the orders of the day:
Mr. Speaker, I should like to direct a question to the Minister of Trade and Commerce. Is the minister aware of the article in the February 5 issue of the Western Producer captioned "Supplementary quota on rye authorized"? The article goes on to say that the Canadian wheat board has authorized a supplementary quota of 5 bushels per seeded acre for rye, subject to a minimum delivery of 150 bushels, at all Alberta delivery points, effective January 26. Can the minister tell us if this quota will be put into effect in Saskatchewan as well; and if so, how soon?


Mr. Speaker, the supplementary delivery quota for rye at Alberta stations was authorized to provide necessary mill supplies in that province, and to make available additional supplies for shipment to the west coast to meet potential sales commitments. Producer deliveries of rye in Saskatchewan and Manitoba normally move to the lakehead, where stocks are presently adequate to meet requirements. It is the intention of the board, however, to extend the supplementary rye quota to Saskatchewan and Manitoba points after the opening of navigation on the great lakes, when further stocks will be required at the lakehead and elevator space will be available.
It is customary for the board to authorize supplementary quotas within specified areas shipping to terminal facilities where stocks are not adequate to meet existing or potential sales commitments.


On the orders of the day:
In view of the fact that the report has now been available for more than six months, and in view of the urgent fiscal need of the provincial government of Newfoundland, can the Prime Minister tell us whether the government will find it possible at an early date to make an announcement about what it is proposed to do about implementing the report of the McNair commission?

Inquiries of the Ministry


Mr. Speaker, I think the Minister of Finance can conveniently answer that question.


As all hon. members are aware, Mr. Speaker, Premier Smallwood was here a week ago-


Two weeks ago.


-or I should say two weeks ago today accompanied by the minister of finance and other officials including Mr. Perlin who had been a member of the provincial royal commission which had advised the province earlier in the matter, and also Mr. Goldenberg who was counsel to the province of Newfoundland in the hearings of the royal commission headed by Chief Justice McNair.
On the Monday morning there was a conference with the Prime Minister, and that afternoon a further conference proceeded in my office. At these conferences the subject was discussed fully from, I think, every possible angle. Indeed, when the conclusion of the afternoon conference was reached Premier Smallwood was good enough to indicate his pleasure at the hearing he had received and at the thorough way in which all aspects of the question had been reviewed in the meetings.
Premier Smallwood continued to indicate that he is not satisfied with the recommendations of the royal commission. There are problems with regard to the duration of payments as well. The report of the royal commission is anything but clear and definite on some points. In the light of the remarks made by Premier Smallwood and his advisers with regard to the report of the royal commission and what action he would like the federal government to take in the light of the recommendations of the royal commission, the whole subject is under active consideration.


On the orders of the day:
Mr. Speaker, I should like to ask the Minister of National Defence whether it is the intention of the government to re-equip the Canadian F-86 air squadrons in Europe with new planes? If so, will the new planes be purchased, as reported, in the United States of America?
Hon. G. R. Pearkes (Minister of National
Defence): Mr. Speaker, it is questionable if the requirements for a day fighter of the type

of the F-86 Sabre for the NATO forces in Europe will exist much longer. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the F-86 Sabre, which at one time was undoubtedly the most efficient fighter in Europe, may have ceased by 1961-62. Consideration is therefore being given to the future role of the air division and the possible replacement of the F-86 by some other aircraft. No decision has yet been reached as to the question of replacing that aircraft, nor as to the type of the aircraft which will replace the F-86, nor where that aircraft will be purchased or made.


that the house go into committee of supply.


Mr. Speaker, this motion affords an opportunity, both with respect to an amendment which I propose to move later in the course of my remarks and, by what I say, to direct the attention of the house to a matter of great national importance at this time, namely the unexplained delay in the reconvening of the dominion-provincial conference, particularly in so far as it affects such matters as fiscal and unemployment questions.
No one in this house will fail to agree on the need for federalism in Canada. Our need, of course, is based upon a number of considerations such as geography, physical diversity, the stretch of our territories, regional differences in resources and economic activity and, of course, cultural diversity.
On the other hand we have in Canada a great number of common problems. All of us certainly want to continue to build up a strong nation, and we want to use the existence of these common problems for that purpose. These basic needs which I mentioned are illustrated by such expressions as "Unity without uniformity" or "Unity out of diversity". In order to be reconciled and to be satisfactorily met, they require federalism or in other words the assignment of specific constitutional responsibilities to different governments.
This requirement was recognized by the fathers of confederation, and indeed it was embedded in the constitution itself. It still exists today as a basic need, and for the same basic reasons as in 1867. Federalism is the only political system through which we in Canada can be united and continue to progress as a nation. But federalism involves the

assignment of specific constitutional responsibilities to different governments wholly independent of one another. However, the solution of many of these problems for which the modern state has to assume ultimate responsibility does not respect the constitutional division of powers, and cannot be found by one sphere of government acting alone. In other words, such problems are the joint responsibility of all spheres of government in a country like our own.
A good illustration of this is unemployment, where for a full and effective solution the joint responsibility of all governments within the federal state is required. Tax cuts, unemployment assistance, public works especially to give work in winter to unemployed persons, are all essential remedies capable of coping with mass unemployment. But their application does not lie within the exclusive jurisdiction of one sphere of government. This requires, then, the co-ordinated action of all governments, including the municipalities.
This illustration shows that federalism cannot function effectively to satisfactorily solve the problems facing a country like Canada if the different spheres of government ignore each other. In other words, interdependence must be recognized in concrete terms. Coordination of all governmental activity is essential. Continuing consultations and discussions between the senior levels of government in particular are necessary.
We have current problems in Canada which require concentration and joint action. We have to face at present several very important problems requiring intergovernmental discussion, joint action and consideration. One of those questions has to do with the matter of constitutional amendment. At the present time we have an anomalous situation. Parliament and the provincial legislatures can change our constitutional provisions in matters concerning both levels of government. However, there is no recognized procedure for amending our constitution, and the United Kingdom parliament still has the final responsibility of changing our constitutional provisions in this respect.
Now, is this not an undesirable situation? The previous administration tried to do something about this problem. It tried to solve it. It brought this subject up for discussion in 1950 at a federal-provincial conference which was specially convened for that particular purpose. There were lengthy discussions, and after those lengthy discussions and consultations, which extended far beyond the conference room, no tangible result was produced. The Prime Minister, good constitutional lawyer that he is, will recognize why that 66968-9-52J
Dominion-Provincial Conference was the result. It was because of the failure of certain provincial leaders who are now friendly with the present Conservative government in office. So it is the responsibility of this government to discuss this important question with the provincial premiers and solve this basic constitutional issue just as quickly as possible.


To which provincial government does the hon. gentleman refer?


I was referring in particular to my friend's colleague, the premier of the province of Quebec. I would hope that because of his well known association and political community of interest with him he would be able to do something that the previous prime minister and the former minister of justice were unable to effect.
Then there is the matter of human rights. VvTe are going to be asked very shortly this session to consider a bill on human rights which apparently would be limited in its application to the federal field of jurisdiction. Quite apart from the substance of this proposed bill, such limitation I think even the Prime Minister, apart from his own immediate responsibility, would regard as being far from satisfactory. Provincial jurisdiction in the field of human rights, through the property and civil rights clause in section 92 of the British North America Act, is very wide indeed, and the government should at least try to find a formula which would permit joint action with respect to a matter so important as this.
This suggestion was made by the Leader of the Opposition in this house on September 5, 1958, when the bill was given its first reading. Here is what the Leader of the Opposition said, and his words are to be found at page 4652 of Hansard:
Indeed, as a result of consultation with the provinces it might be possible to widen the action so as to include both the federal government and provincial governments in a joint declaration on individual rights and freedoms. Then indeed we would have a powerful symbol.


If the hon. gentleman would excuse me, during the period of office of the last government is it not a fact that the various provinces were consulted with respect to this very important matter, and that several of them did not even deign to reply?


I am sure if my right hon. friend says that is the case, that is the situation. My memory does not altogether agree with him, but I could be wrong. All I would say in answer is that that is no excuse now, particularly in light of the fact that some of these former objecting premiers may now be more disposed to


What was the reaction of the government of that day?


I am going to give the house its reaction right now. The reaction was that we, as the government in office at that time, had the responsibility for doing something. So we did call a conference. A preliminary meeting with the provinces was held on April 26 and 27 of 1955 to consider matters of mutual concern, including the problem of unemployment.
That is the answer I give to the right hon. gentleman. We called a conference to do the very thing which we now urge him to do with regard to unemployment and for other reasons I have already mentioned-reasons why this conference, called in the month of November and adjourned at the end of that month, without reconvening in January as had been promised, should now be held. In answer to the question asked by the right hon. gent
