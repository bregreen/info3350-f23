Miss Margaret Aitken (York-Humber) presented the first report of the standing committee on standing orders, and moved that the report be concurred in.
Motion agreed to.
May I inform the house that the committee on procedure has its first report in the course of preparation, in English and in French. I had hoped to be able to present it to the house now. If it should be ready in the course of the afternoon, would the house permit me to present it when it is ready?


Agreed.


I have the honour to present in English and French the unanimous first report of the special committee appointed to consider with Mr. Speaker the procedure of the house. This is done pursuant to leave given earlier today. The report will be printed in Votes and Proceedings.


I wish to table the text of the 1962 international wheat agreement in its original version, which is in English. I am also tabling a French translation. For the convenience of hon. members I ask leave to have the text of the agreemeent published as an appendix to today's Hansard. Following the usual practice, both houses of parliament will be asked to approve by resolution Canada's ratification of the agreement.


Has the minister leave to table the document tendered just now?


Agreed.


And has the minister leave to have it printed as an appendix to Hansard?


Agreed.
[Editor's note: For text of document referred to above, see appendix to Hansard for Wednesday, April 11, 1962.]


May I have leave to present a further problem. The Minister of Agriculture presented today, and got leave of the house to have printed as a schedule to Hansard, a very lengthy document. Hansard today will be lengthy enough without the addition of a further 50 pages and, subject to the approval of the house, I have taken the liberty of having this document printed as an appendix to tomorrow's Hansard rather than today's. Is it agreed?


Agreed.


Mr. Speaker, as the house is aware there is a vacancy on the international joint commission. I wish to announce that the governor in council has today appointed Mr. Arnold D. P. Heeney, presently our ambassador to the United States, to that position. His appointment becomes effective on the 15th of this month.
Mr. Heeney will remain for a few days as ambassador in Washington before returning to Ottawa. Naturally I am very pleased that Mr. Heeney has accepted this position. The house is fully aware of his distinguished record and qualifications. As a student and teacher of international legal matters, as one time secretary to the cabinet, as former under secretary of state for external affairs and as ambassador to the United States, he has for many years been concerned with those matters which will come under his interest and consideration in this new position.


I am sure the house will have heard with some interest the announcement which the Prime Minister has made. This announcement gives us on this side of the house an opportunity to pay tribute to the work that
2658	HOUSE OF
St. Lawrence Pilots Work Stoppage General McNaughton has done on the international joint commission and to his distinguished service to Canada in war

from the first world war-and in peace. General McNaughton is a man whose integrity, honesty and honour are above reproach and are recognized on all sides.
As he is leaving the international joint commission I cannot think of anybody better equipped for that position than the man who has been mentioned by the Prime Minister as the new chairman of the Canadian section. Mr. Heeney, as the Prime Minister has said, is also a very distinguished public servant. He has filled many important posts, and he has filled them all with great distinction. I am sure he will fill this one with great distinction too.


Mr. Speaker, I and the members of this group wholeheartedly join with the leader of the official opposition in paying tribute to General McNaughton and the great service he has rendered to Canada, in world war I and world war II, as president of the national research council, as a member of the joint Canadian-American committee on defence, and in other organizations, and particularly during the last 10 years as chairman of the international joint commission. In that regard, Mr. Speaker, he was fully qualified to occupy the position because of his capabilities as a scientist, an engineer and an administrator.
With respect to the announcement made by the Prime Minister, I must frankly say that while we in this group recognize the record of the gentleman who has been appointed, in the Department of External Affairs, as an ambassador and in other posts, we say most emphatically that this position requires a man of at least equal ability with respect to scientific and engineering knowledge, and as an administrator, to General McNaughton, and we are of the opinion that Mr. Heeney does not fulfil those requirements.
(Translation):


Mr. Speaker, certain questions were asked yesterday about the work stoppage of the St. Lawrence pilots and as to the legality of that stoppage. When those questions were being asked, I was having separate talks with the shipowners and the representatives of the pilots.
From a legal point of view, pilots are not party to individual or collective contracts, but hold positions which under the government certificate constitute a monopoly. The gov-
[Mr. Pearson.)

eminent collects fees from the shipowners, which are afterwards handed over to the pilots to be divided among themselves. Section 329 of the Canada Shipping Act and pilotage regulations enacted by order in council under that section specifically provide that pilots must carry out their pilotage duties; their present refusal to do so is therefore illegal.
Yesterday I met with representatives of the Shipping Federation of Canada and of the Canadian Shipowners Association; meanwhile, officials of my department were in touch with the Dominion Marine Association. Those associations represent all the shipowners involved. They claim that since the work stoppage is illegal, they would greatly jeopardize their future situation if they were to enter into direct negotiations with the pilots before there is any indication that the stoppage is nearly over. They stated that they have had a lot of trouble with the pilots in that connection these past few years; in their opinion, the consequences of such steps taken by the pilots in recent years are so serious that the situation calls for a public investigation.
They informed me that, under the circumstances, they will do everything they can to continue the operation of their ships without the help of pilots, even though that may cause some delay; in their opinion, such action will not interfere with shipping. They stated that, in their opinion, the situation has reached the point where they have to accept a continuous suspension of work, if need be, in their own long-term interest. As for me, I asked them not to take an unyielding attitude in this matter and I expressed the hope that they would agree to another meeting with the pilots.
I then met the pilots' federation representatives from the main pilotage districts of Quebec, Montreal, Montreal harbour, Cornwall and Kingston. I explained the shipowners' stand to them and I gave them to understand that they were violating the clauses of the Canada Shipping Act and the pilotage regulations established thereunder in refusing to perform their duties, adding that I greatly regretted that they had seen fit to take that step on a short twenty-four hours' notice. I also conveyed to them my feeling that the shipowners no doubt firmly intended to see that the ships' movement was not interrupted.
In view of the fact that the pilots had mentioned certain delays and difficulties in connection with their working conditions, we looked into the background in that regard and I pointed out to them that out of the five

main points concerning working conditions which, in their opinion, were pending, we had already accepted two and agreed in principle to two more by undertaking to work out the details of their application, and that we also had decided to pursue with them the consideration of the fifth point. I also pointed out to them that there had been no undue delay in the consideration of those matters, that, in fact, the pilots had submitted their brief less than two months ago and that several meetings and interviews had taken place since then.
We found that the main issue the pilots wished to settle concerned their income and the increase asked for by three pilotage districts. I informed them that in view of the present level of income and working conditions, their requests in that respect had seemed exaggerated, not only to the shipowners but to myself, and I asked them to meet my officials in order to study these requests in greater detail and to see if they could be modified. The requested increase in fees to be paid by the vessels came to approximately 18 per cent in the Cornwall and Montreal districts, and it remained practically the same during the following discussions, although it seemed that an adjustment could be made with regard to Montreal harbour. No important issue concerning income was involved in the Quebec and Kingston districts.
I asked the pilots to put an end to their work stoppage, in view of the fact that the pilots' federation had assured me that in such a case the shipping federation would be willing to meet immediately the pilots' representatives to study new propositions with regard to the whole question and the income the shipping federation is willing to give the pilots. Up to now the pilots' representatives have not indicated they were willing to change the requests I have mentioned or to put an end to the work stoppage.
I regret that situation because I firmly believe that the shipowners intention not to stop the ships movement can only be damaging to the pilots. I should like to add also that I believe the time has come to undertake a general investigation on all questions relating to pilotage, and I expect to submit later some proposals to be examined by the government. However, I will continue to seek a solution to this problem, and after studying further the results of yesterday's meetings I will continue to keep in touch with the various agencies involved.


Mr. Speaker, it is obvious, considering what the
10, 1962
St. Lawrence Pilots Work Stoppage minister just said, that he was not successful in his effort to get the pilots and ship owners together with a view to settling the dispute. It is also apparent that, notwithstanding what the minister said, namely that the pilots have held meetings with only 24 hours notice is not true, because, according to the pilots themselves they have been discussing the matter with the department since February last. Any way, Mr. Speaker, it is quite clear that this dispute is very prejudicial to the Canadian economy, as well as to the passengers who are now on the Empress of Britain quite apart from being a menace to navigation, of which the department is certainly aware.
There were already two ships, the Consuelo and another one, the name of which I forget-
(Text):


The "Pearson Boat"! (Translation):


-which ran aground, causing considerable damage, because of the absence of a St. Lawrence pilot.
Moreover, Mr. Speaker, there is at this time a ship carrying flammable goods sailing up the St. Lawrence. I wonder whether the Department of Transport gave some consideration to the menace this represents for the communities and towns past which this vessel will sail.
Another most important point is that the minister, after having, through his officials, invited both parties to meet, did not ask the pilots to go to Montreal to discuss the situation with the shipowners.
I know that yesterday he asked them to come here, because both parties had apparently not succeeded in arranging a meeting. Now, when they arrived here, the minister told them that the strike was illegal, that they should go back to work and free the Empress of Britain, adding that their claims were excessive and suggesting that they review their requests.
Everybody knows that the main points under dispute are rather serious and significant, and that the main point concerns a rate increase. But what the minister seems to forget is that the tonnage of St. Lawrence vessels has developed considerably, whereas the pilots' rates have scarcely been raised. Now, it is true that on the St. Lawrence seaway ships of 2,500 to 3,000 tons have largely disappeared, so that today pilots have to steer vessels of 20,000, 25,000 and under certain circumstances, even 28,000 tons.
That is one of the main reasons why they complain of not having benefited from a rate increase proportionate to the expansion of tonnage. I am more particularly thinking of

St. Lawrence Pilots Work Stoppage the Montreal and Cornwall pilots. I notice that my hon. friend from Stormont (Mr. Campbell) is not in his seat-


Neither are you in your seat, I mean in Laurier.


-because, when the question of pilots was raised last year, the hon. member for Stormont stated that there were none in his constituency. Yet, Mr. Speaker -
(Text):


Order. I seem to hear more voices than one. Perhaps I am mistaken, but I think not.
(Translation):


However, Mr. Speaker, the cost of pilotage in that district decreased by 300 per cent, if we take into account the increase in tonnage, and those figures bear no resemblance whatsoever to those given by the minister.
Now, according to the minister, an increase of 16 per cent is sought by the pilots travelling between Montreal and Quebec. And- I am not sure whether the minister mentioned it in the statement he just made-I understand the pilots pledged the minister their word that they would sign an agreement for a period of three years, under the provision that the tariffs be increased, and they have agreed to give full consideration to the whole issue of pilotage during that period of three years.
I need not tell the house, Mr. Speaker, that the course followed for the settlement of this dispute is completely outmoded.
I appreciate that the minister is subject to the clauses of the Canada Shipping Act and that, as the authority over pilotage, he must comply with the law. But this dispute should be settled in the same way as all others.
(Text):


Order. The discussion is rather unusual. The subject is complicated, it is true, and the hon. member for Laurier is discussing it in considerable detail and going somewhat beyond the statement made by the minister. I have not interfered, but I feel that the hon. member should keep his comments within as narrow a compass as he reasonably can, and that he should also be prepared to agree, with respect to the new matter he has raised, that the minister, if he wishes to do so, is free to comment on that matter.
(Translation):


I shall try to abide by your ruling, Mr. Speaker, but it should not be forgotten that the minister made a long statement, obviously prepared by his officials and dealing with the circumstances of the interview he had with the pilots.

Under the circumstances it should not be forgotten that the opposition has the right to reply to certain allegations made by the minister. He said, for instance, that the pilots had only given 24-hour notice before holding their meetings, which is incorrect, for the pilots have been requesting since last February to meet with the officials of the transport department and to have an interview with the minister himself, because they were unable to come to an agreement with the shipowners.
Now, in short, Mr. Speaker, the minister was arrogant with the pilots yesterday. He-
(Text):


Order. The hon. member's comment goes beyond the ordinary comment that is permissible on ministerial statements, and I would ask him not to make a debate of this matter. It is true that the circumstances recounted by the minister in his statement constituted a narrative of some length and complication, and that if one commented on everything he said it might take considerable time, but that does not make this an opportunity for a debate. I would ask the hon. member for Laurier, who has had very full time, in fact more time than the minister himself took, to bring his remarks to a close.
(Translation):


Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.
(Text):


Order. Perhaps the minister would indicate why he is rising.
(Translation):


I rise on a point of order. I do not object to my hon. friend commenting on my statement and explaining in this house the opposition's stand concerning pilotage. But when he states that this or that statement is false and that I showed arrogance etc., I submit that it has nothing to do with the statement I just made, and I feel that the hon. member for Laurier is out of order.
He can comment upon my statement; but he has raised three or four points which are absolutely false, or at least do not give a true picture of what has happened.
However, I should like to have the privilege of answering him so that the house may not be left under a false impression and faced with certain allegations which are not borne out by the facts.
(Text):


I accept the minister's view. As a matter of fact I had risen to indicate to the hon. member for Laurier that I too

felt he had gone too far and I have also indicated to the hon. member for Laurier that I feel it would be proper to permit the Minister of Transport to comment when the hon. member finishes.
(Translation):


Mr. Speaker, there is no point of order at all. The minister evidently is not aware of the rules-
(Text):


Order. Perhaps the hon. member would complete his statement. The point of order has been disposed of.
(Translation):


Well, Mr. Speaker, there are three important points which are apparent from the minister's statement. First, pilots and shipowners-
Mr. Speaker, may I ask you to call the hon. members to order? It seems to me-
(Text):


Order. No contribution is being made to the conduct of the affairs of the house if hon. members make it difficult for the member who has the floor to carry on his remarks.
(Translation):


Mr. Speaker, we on this side of the house have listened closely to the minister's statement and I think-


Because it made sense.


I think it is only proper that a member speaking on behalf of the opposition should be listened to in the same way.
In conclusion, I should like to say that three points of capital importance are involved in this dispute. First of all, this strike is greatly prejudicial to the Canadian economy; second, it is a cause of serious inconvenience to travellers; and last, but most important, this dispute endangers the safety of navigation on the St. Lawrence.
I say, with all due respect to the minister, and I think he will agree, that he failed to take those three points into account when he met with the parties.
In view of what has been said, I urge him to bring once again the pilots and shipowners together so that they may reach an agreement.
(Text):


Would the minister wish to comment now or to wait until I have heard the member for Port Arthur?


I can comment now, Mr. Speaker.
26207-1-170
St. Lawrence Pilots Work Stoppage (Translation) :


Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Laurier raised three points about which I am in full agreement with him. That is why I met the shipowners and the pilots yesterday. I asked the pilots to return to work and I asked the owners to be more flexible and try to understand the situation.
I should now like to reply to the statement made by the hon. member for Laurier, to the effect that I treated the pilots with arrogance. I do not think there has ever been a minister of transport as patient with the pilots as I have been and I should add that the pilots have never been so well treated as they have been these last three years.
Yesterday I had the opportunity of listing about 60 items of things we have done for the pilots. I think my predecessor and myself have always treated the pilots with fairness.
The only point I represented to the pilots yesterday is that they will be the first to suffer from the strike, which is illegal; they are doing damage to themselves. I think they exaggerate.
I asked them to reconsider the situation, to modify their claims to make them reasonable, and to try to reduce them to a minimum, taking into account not only their personal interest but that of the public at large. On that we parted. My officials met the pilots and discussed with them. As far as I am concerned I am prepared to meet them anytime. I asked them to consider that point.
As far as the 24-hour notice is concerned, I received word from the pilots that the strike was scheduled to begin Thursday night. Now, I received their telegram Wednesday night, and the shipowners received a similar telegram at 5.15 p.m.
This is too short a notice and I submit that in view of that short notice, several people have suffered a great deal of inconvenience, which they would not have had to suffer if notice had been given earlier.
I sincerely believe that the owners and the pilots should consider the problem calmly and try to reach an agreement in order to contribute their share to maintaining that feeling of optimism which now prevails in the economy of the country, and thus work together for the prosperity of Canada.
(Text):


Mr. Speaker, it is very apparent that the co-operation the minister seeks has been made somewhat more difficult by the fact that he has
2662	HOUSE OF
Inquiries of the Ministry given an indication that the strike is illegal. It seems to me it would follow that if it is an illegal strike he should be suggesting not so much that there is going to be a general investigation into pilotage but what particular steps he intends to take to make sure that the river is opened again to traffic.
I never anticipated that I would be sympathetic to the shipping federation of Canada in a situation, but it does seem to me that in this particular case the pilots gave inadequate indication both as to their grievances and as to the time involved. I certainly have a great deal of sympathy with the Department of Transport in its general pilotage problem as reflected by the situation in this part of the river.
The minister probably knows that there are at least four different systems of pilotage on the great lakes and the St. Lawrence seaway, and one of the idiosyncrasies is that the particular group on strike at the present time seems to be a traditional or almost a family group. I can only say that their approach, in either union terms or terms of their work, is unique and unlike the pattern of the rest of the system. If the minister is indicating he is going to hold an inquiry that is to be allembracing, to investigate pilotage on the whole system, I think we on the upper lakes would be interested, as would everyone else. I believe there is a certain anachronism in the step-up that exists on the river system. I hope this could be cleared up before we are left with a very bad situation to start the shipping season.
It seems to me that responsibility for that solution finally must devolve upon the minister. I suggest to him that in this particular area he get the people from the Canada labour relations board to work immediately, even in an unofficial way, in order to get some kind of settlement going rather than continue with this indefinite basis under which we have an illegal strike indicated, and at the same time a rather pious hope by the minister that the strikers and the companies will get together.
(Translation):


Mr. Speaker, may I put a question to the Minister of Transport. In view of the dispute mentioned a moment ago, does the minister intend to afford any protection to the riparian localities from the hazard of ships carrying flammable and explosive material?


Mr. Speaker, the Department of Transport continues to assume responsibility for shipping in the St. Lawrence river. We intend to maintain all navigational aids and to enforce all regulations presently in force in that section of Canada's navigable waters.


Mr. Speaker, I should like to ask the Minister of Transport a supplementary question. Have the officials of the Department of Transport carried out an investigation in the breakage of a telephone cable by the steamship Consuelo, near Quebec city, and can the minister report to the house on that matter?


No, Mr. Speaker, I have nothing to report. I could not say at this time whether it will be officials of my department who will investigate the breakage of that cable.
(Text):


On the orders of the day:
Mr. Speaker, I should like to ask the Prime Minister whether he would follow the course normally followed at this time of the session by him and his predecessors, and inform the house as to the date of the beginning of the Easter recess and the measures which the government hopes to have passed before that recess, as well as the order of priority attached to those measures.
Right Hon. J. G. Diefenbaker (Prime
Minister): I will give consideration to that question, Mr. Speaker. I will look over the order paper and endeavour to give a general outline of some of the matters that would be brought before the house.


May
I ask the Prime Minister a supplementary question. It is a great convenience to western members to know the date of the Easter recess. When the Prime Minister is giving the other information, will he tell us when the Easter recess will commence?


I think the Easter recess generally commences some days in advance of Good Friday.


On the orders of the day:
I wish to
direct a question to the Minister of Fisheries. Since the lobster fishermen of district 7B in Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island lost the first three weeks of the 1961 fishing season because of abnormal ice conditions, would the minister consider advancing the opening date for the district concerned for this year from May 1 to April 24 or April 25, in order to provide these fishermen with an opportunity to resume their fishing operations at an earlier date?


Mr. Speaker, my department has considered this possibility. As the hon. member will recall, although lobster fishing in district 7B opened late last year it also continued a few days later than normal, with the result that the average fisherman had a normal year. There were a few areas which were exceptions to this rule. We have considered the possibility the hon. member has suggested, but have found that it would not be practical because full advantage could not be taken of such an early opening in all districts and this would unfairly spread the advantage, if any, which might accrue from an early opening.
It is expected, therefore, that the season in district 7B will open on May 1, which is the normal time.


On the orders of the day:
wish to direct a question to the Minister of Justice or, in his absence, to his parliamentary secretary. Would the minister please advise if he is in a position to report on the complaints received by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police from Captain Moss, of the sealing ship North Star, that his men had been attacked by pirates who took rifles from his men and stole their seal pelts? Will he comment also on an article in this morning's Globe and Mail to the effect that Captain James Gillette of the Arctic Sealer reported that five helicopters spent three days last week taking pelts belonging to his ship?


I am not
sure of these allegations, but this matter is
26207-1-1704
Inquiries of the Ministry under active consideration by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. When the investigation has made sufficient progress I shall be pleased to see that a report is given to the house.


Mr. Speaker, would the Minister of Fisheries be prepared to comment on the hon. member's question?


I could add, in reply, that the officers of my department have also gone by helicopter to the area from which these allegations arose to investigate the possibility of cancelling licences for sealing operations, if- such a course should be advisable.


On the orders of the day:
wish to direct a question to the Minister of National Revenue. On February 7, as recorded at page 631 of Hansard, my question No. 124 concerning books banned or prohibited entry into Canada by the Department of National Revenue was passed as an order for return. I know the minister has been checking over this list for me, but time is growing short. Is the minister now in a position to comply with the order of the house?


I will check on this order and advise the house in a short time.
(Translation):


On the orders of the day:
Mr. Speaker, I should like to put a question to the Minister of Transport. Can he tell the house if the meeting between the representatives of his department and those of the provincial government of Quebec and the city of Montreal in regard to the abolition of tolls on bridges was held yesterday, and if so what were the results of these talks?


Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Chambly-Rouville (Mr. Johnson) advised me of his intention to ask such a question. I want to tell him and also the hon. member for St. Ann that following a conversation between the premier of the province of Quebec, Mr. Lesage, and myself, it was agreed that the meeting which was to be held yesterday be postponed to Wednesday afternoon in Ottawa.

Inquiries of the Ministry


Mr. Speaker, I wish to ask a supplementary question. Could the Minister of Transport tell the house if the delay by the provincial government of Quebec in accepting the conditions is due to the very important problems facing the government of Quebec and the failure of its policy?
(Text):


On the orders of the day:
I have a question for the Minister of Public Works. I should like to ask him what precautions, if any, Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation takes to ensure that building contractors getting the benefits of N.H.A. lending are financially responsible, thereby giving some assurance that innocent home builders will not lose their deposit money.


It would seem to be quite a detailed question, and I would be very happy to accept it as notice.


On the orders of the day:
I should like to direct a question to the Minister of National Revenue. Since for the first time in 20 years the Allan cup final will be contested between a western team and a team from the province of Quebec, the powerful Montreal Olympics, and that the final series will be played entirely in the west, will the minister ask the C.B.C. to give T.V. coverage for these games of national interest?


I shall take that matter up with the C.B.C. but in view of the fact that another important series is starting tonight and may run on for two weeks, I am not sure whether the C.B.C. will be able to make commitments with respect to alternative programs, but I shall advise the house in due course.


On a
point of order, Mr. Speaker, the Montreal Olympics are not the eastern champions. A team from northern Ontario is still fighting in the series.


I am afraid hon. members will be asking us to place bets if this goes on.


On the orders of the day:
I wish to direct a question to the Minister of Public Works. Can the minister indicate the proposed date of the tender call for construction of the new federal building in Brockville?


The answer is today.
(Translation):


On the orders of the day:
Mr. Speaker, I should like to put a question to the Prime Minister. According to the Conservateur Canadien -


Order.


Do you hear, Mr. Speaker? You know that voice.
According to the Conservateur Canadien, the Minister of Mines and Technical Surveys (Mr. Flynn) was a lawyer and a local attorney for the wartime prices and trade board. If such was the case, does the Prime Minister think of his Minister of Mines and Technical Surveys as one of those wartime bureaucrats that he criticized lately, and for similar reasons? May I expect an answer?


He does not understand French very well.


You do not understand
French very well yourself.
(Text):


Surely the Prime Minister will answer that.


Not even the translators can. Mr. Speaker: The hon. member has asked his question. I am not responsible for seeing that he gets a reply.


It is not an intelligent question. Mr. Speaker:	If the hon. member for
Chambly-Rouville wishes to speak, he will take the floor.


Hear, hear.


It is a question of privilege, Mr. Speaker. I was just taking up a remark by an hon. member of the opposition which was a rather unethical reflection on the Prime Minister.


Well, the hon. member has now taken the proper course, and if he wishes to pursue the matter I shall be glad to hear him.


Go ahead.
(Translation):


Mr. Speaker, there had to be among the Liberal members a wise guy to mention the Prime Minister's ability to speak French. I should like to make sure, first, whether the hon. member speaks French correctly himself.


That is easy-he knows neither French nor English.


On the orders of the day:
May I ask the
Minister of Transport a question? Could he tell us whether, since he took over the department, any person or organization has undertaken to pay or indeed has paid for the use of government planes for any purpose? If so, which persons or organizations?
(Text):


I think another question for the order paper is indicated.


On the orders of the day:
should like to direct a question to the Minister of Public Works, and ask whether plans have been completed, tenders called and contracts let for the construction of a building to confine Doukhobors in the Agassiz area, convicted under the Criminal Code?


I would be very happy to accept this question as notice.


Mr. Speaker, I should like to address a question to the Minister of Justice-may I say that I am glad the Minister of Public Works is here-or in the minister's absence could I direct my question to the Acting Minister of Justice or the parliamentary secretary. Could I ask on what basis, in view of the emergency, an award has been made for the construction of the Doukhobor restraining building in the area of Agassiz,
Inquiries of the Ministry not through the Department of Public Works on contract but by a t.m. plus profit contract through the department.


Order. I think questions about contracts, and so on, might very well go on the order paper rather than taking up the time of the house.


On the orders of the day:
I should like to direct a question to the Acting Minister of Justice. Can the acting minister give us a report about the inquiry of the R.C.M.P. in the constituency of Bellechasse, which was announced by the Secretary of State on March 26 as having top priority?
Hon. W. J. Browne (Acting Minister of
Justice): I shall take that question as notice.


On the orders of the day:
I should like to direct a question to the Prime Minister and ask him whether the government intends to grant an additional transcontinental air service to C.P.A., as reported in Saturday's edition of the Financial Post"!


Whenever any decision is made with regard to such a matter it will be brought to the attention of the house. It will not be announced through the medium of speculative stories in any newspaper.


As a supplementary question to the Prime Minister, has an application been made to the cabinet under the Aeronautics Act for the purpose I have mentioned, namely to give additional transcontinental air services to C.P.A.?


The answer is no.


On the orders of the day:
should like to direct a question to the Acting Minister of Labour, or to the parliamentary secretary to the Minister of Labour. In view of the fact that many people working on a commission basis now receive annual holidays with pay, is the minister in a position to

Inquiries of the Ministry explain why Canadian government annuities representatives are not in receipt of annual holidays with pay?


I shall take that question as notice.


On the orders of the day:
I wish to direct a question to the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister inform the house whether he has received representations from Premier Stanfield of Nova Scotia and Premier Robichaud of New Brunswick with regard to further utilization of maritime coal by local industries? If so, will the Prime Minister advise the house what action, if any, has been taken to implement the suggestions or recommendations submitted in the premiers' brief?


I shall take that question as notice.

On the orders of the day:
Mr. Speaker, I should like to direct a question to the Postmaster General. Since he is in the Prime Minister's confidence-

Order.
(Text):


Order. I am sorry, but for some time I have heard Interruptions from the far end of the chamber which I think are not in the best interests of the dignity and conduct of business of this house and I would ask hon. members, without mentioning any names, who feel that the cap fits, to better observe the proprieties. I make no apology for rising because, if hon. members will reflect on the course of our proceedings during the past few days, I think they will agree that we have a dignity to maintain in the eyes of the country, and also we have work to do.

(Translation):


Mr. Speaker, I rise on a question of privilege concerning the comments you have just made.
I should like to inform you, with all due respect, that I was the one who objected to the question that the hon. member for St. Denis was about to ask, because, knowing the kind of questions he has been asking for four years, I was sure that, as usual, it would be an insignificant one designed simply to waste the time of the house and its members.
(Text):


I shall always be glad to hear a point of order from the hon. member, but I can scarcely make the assumption in advance that a point of order will arise.
(Translation):


Mr. Speaker, now that we have silence in the house, may I repeat my question to the Postmaster General? Since he is in the Prime Minister's confidence, does he feel he will be able to explain to the house-


Order.


-before the end of the session the deficit of more than $4 million shown by his department?


Order.


The hon. member for Roberval was right.
(Text):


Perhaps the minister would permit me to say that questions of that kind relating to financial affairs are normally dealt with on the estimates and in the budget. The invitation to deal with the finances of a department in general on the orders of the day is quite improper and out of order.


Hear, hear.


I think it should be done before dissolution of parliament.


I appreciate the hon. member's anxiety to get on with it, but he is out of order.


On the orders of the day:
Mr. Speaker, in the light of a telegram I have received from the president of the professional SkyCaps I should like to direct a question to the Minister of Transport. My question is this.

Is it a fact that the president of the professional Sky-Caps, who has been a porter at Dorval airport for some eight or nine years, and 14 of his fellow porters have been arrested by the R.C.M.P. for carrying passengers' bags at the terminal? If so, can the minister give the reason for this arrest, and did the minister notify the president that he could no longer work at Dorval without his written permission?





Order. Did the hon. member give notice of the question?


I think, Mr. Speaker, I can answer the question simply. I would like to state that following the great deal of trouble we had at Dorval airport the department decided to bring porters under the civil service commission. In so doing the department invited all the porters engaged in the carrying of bags at Dorval airport to submit applications. Over 40 of the Sky-Caps have submitted those applications and they have been hired; another three refused to take up this offer of the department, and another four or five insisted on certain other conditions and refused to accept the positions offered to them.
This group of professional Sky-Caps kept on working at the airport while a decision was being obtained from the court on a writ of injunction. Pending the decision the department did not do anything as far as these porters were concerned. However, now that a decision on the writ has been rendered, these porters have been notified that they should not carry on their activities at the airport as they have refused the positions offered to them by the department.
I do not know about the arrest of these porters. I just wanted to give the situation to the house and make it very clear that we have offered jobs to all the porters who were working at the airport during the last year.


May I ask a supplementary question arising out of the statement the minister has made. It is said that a writ of prohibition has been issued by the superior court against the Department of Transport, I understand. Does the minister not think that pending the decision of the court those 14 men who have not accepted the proposal of the minister should be allowed to carry bags at the airport?


As I said, Mr. Speaker, a decision has been rendered, and following that decision these people were told they had no business working there.
Inquiries of the Ministry TRADE


On the orders of the day:
Mr. Speaker, may I address a question to the parliamentary secretary to the Minister of Labour, in the absence of the minister. Is the Department of Labour studying the submissions of the trade union economists from The Netherlands, Sweden, France and the United Kingdom who met recently at Niagara Falls and discussed the methods whereby labour, management and government in Europe have contrived to co-operate more effectively in the public interest?


Order. The hon. member poses a very interesting question in general terms, but perhaps it would be more appropriately raised in debate.


On the orders of the day:
Mr. Speaker, yesterday on the orders of the day the hon. member for Leeds asked the following question:
-I should like to address a question to the parliamentary secretary. It arises out of the answer given on March 8, 1962 to this question:
What is the age of the oldest butter now in storage?
The answer given was "August, 1960". Would the parliamentary secretary to the Minister of Agriculture advise the house whether the government intends to place this butter, produced in August, 1960, on the market?
The answer, Mr. Speaker, is no, not as butter. At the present time the butter being offered for sale was manufactured in 1961 or later. All butter manufactured prior to 1961 has been or is in the process of being converted to butter oil.


On the orders of the day:
Mr. Speaker, I would like to ask the minister responsible for Northern Ontario Pipe Line Crown Corporation a question which stems from the recent legislation passed by the Ontario legislature giving municipalities the right to tax pipe lines. I wish to ask the minister what effect this legislation has upon the revenues of Northern Ontario Pipe Line Crown Corporation.

Inquiries of the Ministry


Order. I suggest the question might go on the order paper. I do not expect that the hon. member really looked for an answer off the cuff.


On the orders of the day:
Mr. Speaker, before the orders of the day are called I wonder if I could direct a question to the Minister of National Health and Welfare and ask the minister whether his attention has been drawn to a news item in yesterday's Ottawa Citizen emanating from Fort Nelson, British Columbia, which indicates that a Dr. Raymond March said yesterday that several children died on remote northern Indian reserves this winter because a doctor could not reach them in time. Has the minister any comment to make thereon?


Mr. Speaker, I have not seen this article and as a consequence have no comment to make. However, the house will recall that the hon. member for Skeena and the hon. member for Bonavista-Twillingate have taken up with me on previous occasions the alleged problems of the Indians of the Prophet river reserve in British Columbia. This morning I received the following further report in my capacity as Acting Minister of Citizenship and Immigration.
The report from the British Columbia Indian commissioner was received by the department this morning. The commissioner reports that as of March 30, the day he visited the Prophet river community, there was no sickness in the community itself and only two of the 59 Indians living there were still in the Fort Nelson hospital.
The commissioner questioned each of the families living at Prophet river as to conditions prevailing on the week end of March 17, when the epidemic of sickness occurred. Two families are on permanent assistance, three heads of families have trap lines, and five others have been employed at a saw mill a short distance from where they live. All heads of families confirmed that they had not been suffering from any shortage of food prior to the time when they were taken ill.
The agency superintendent or his representative has visited the community each month, except for December, since last October. The provincial public health nurse visited early in March and reported nothing usual. In addition, a school teacher has 

lived with the Indians in the community at Prophet river throughout the winter, and has been in a position to report any health or welfare conditions requiring attention. Unfortunately she was absent from Prophet river on week-end leave Saturday, March 17, when the epidemic developed. The Indians therefore telephoned the doctor in Fort Nelson, Dr. March, who visited Prophet river, taking along with him the editor of the Fort Nelson newspaper.
Dr. March deserves a great deal of credit for the prompt action he took in coping with the situation which he found on arrival at Prophet river on March 18. His prompt and effective action undoubtedly was responsible for the rapid recovery of the Indians who were overtaken by illness.
At the same time it seems clear from reports received from the commissioner, from the provincial health authorities and from other independent sources that charges of malnutrition among this group of Indians, and accusations of neglect on the part of responsible officials, were not justified.


The house resumed, from Monday, April 9, consideration in committee of the following resolution-Mr. Diefenbaker-Mr. Martineau in the chair:
That it is expedient to introduce a measure respecting the establishment of an electoral boundaries commission for the readjustment of representation in the House of Commons; to provide that certain members of the commission may be paid such per diem allowance as may be fixed by the governor in council; to provide for the payment of reasonable travelling and living expenses for the members of the commission; and to provide also that the commission may engage the services of such technical advisers and other staff, including a person to act as secretary to the commission, as it deems necessary.
I do not intend to traverse today any of the ground I covered last evening except to repeat the final point I made, because unless I do so I think what I have to say would lack continuity.
I had pointed out that in almost every case since confederation, except in 1945 when a constitutional amendment had been made so that the constitution could be set aside until after the war, after the completion of the census there has been no election without first of all a redistribution. The only years in which an election came soon after the year for the taking of the census were 1872, 1882 and, of course, 1911, if one regards the taking of the census as being merely the day on which the information is collected from the population. If the date was June 1, as it is

nowadays, that would presumably have been done before the election was held; I have not checked to see. However, I think it is clear that in the 1911 case the census had not been completed.
I pointed out last night that if the government had been seriously concerned about carrying out the pledge made by the Prime Minister in 1957, this legislation would have been introduced for the first time at least two years ago. I say this because when one is altering the pattern of 90 years and dealing with one of the most fundamental features of our constitution, the composition of this house, it is evident that no hasty action ought to be taken at a time which a lot of people may regard-though I have never said so- as being somewhere near the end of this parliament. These steps should have been taken in such time as to allow plenty of opportunity for appropriate consideration not only by the house but also by the public, whose servants we are, of this bill by virtue of which a fundamental and important departure is to be made.
The right course would have been to have introduced this legislation in 1960 at the latest, though not to have attempted to pass it in that year. As has been done with regard to many other important bills, it should have been left on the table for a year so the public might have given proper consideration to it. Then the government could have introduced the bill again in the following year, almost certainly in an amended form, and the matter could have been disposed of by this house and the other place.
I also pointed out that though of course the government has to take the initiative in this matter, first because the Prime Minister is the leader of the house and, second, because the expenditure of money is involved in connection with payment to a commission, the bill nevertheless should in no other respects be regarded as a government measure. We are dealing with a measure which is of no more concern, or should be of no more concern, to the government than it is to anyone else in the house. I am sure the Prime Minister will agree with that proposition, though he may not agree wit
