Last December, Mr. Speaker, I announced that the government had decided to extend its diplomatic relations with the independent states of Africa by opening new diplomatic missions in Tanganyika and the Federal Republic of Cameroon. I am pleased to announce today that an experienced officer of my department, Mr. Norman Berlis, has been appointed as the first Canadian high commissioner to Dar-es-Salaam, Tanganyika.
This appointment is a mark of the importance which the government attaches to the establishment of close relations between this new member of the commonwealth and Canada. Mr. Berlis, a native of Toronto, is a graduate of the University of Toronto and Osgoode Hall, and has had extensive service for Canada both during the war and in the Department of External Affairs. At present he is head of the information division. The Canadian mission in Dar-es-Salaam will have important functions to fulfil, particularly in the field of educational and technical assistance under the special commonwealth African aid program.
As an example of the close and friendly cooperation between Canada and the former British colonies in Africa, the house might be interested to know that during the visit to Ottawa on December 17 of the chief minister of Uganda, Hon. B. K. W. Kiwanuka, who is the first minister, I discussed with him the ways in which Canada might be able to extend assistance to his country under the special commonwealth aid to Africa program. The proposal to which he gave highest priority was the attachment of a senior foreign service officer to the Canadian delegation to the United Nations in New York.
I am glad to be able to inform the house that we have already acted on this request. Mr. A. K. Kironde, a former Uganda minister of works, who is to become ambassador and head of the Uganda delegation to the United Nations when his country becomes independent on October 9 of this year, has joined our New 26207-1-19
York delegation as an observer as of January 25 after spending three days in Ottawa, and he will continue with the delegation until he becomes permanent representative of Uganda. Canada is paying his expenses from our special commonwealth aid to Africa funds.
The appointment of Mr. Berlis and this request from Uganda that we help to train their permanent representative at the United Nations are very significant moves, because they are the first moves into east Africa; in due course our high commissioner to Tanganyika will probably also be credited to Uganda and to Kenya.

Proposed Legislation


Mr. Fleming, Eglinton, moves that the said bill be now read the first time.


Mr. Speaker, we have asked the minister to give us an explanation of this bill and he has simply rephrased or paraphrased what is already referred to in the title of the bill. The way to give an explanation is to give us the particular with respect to which there will be an amendment.


Order. A bill is not debatable on first reading, and while the house is entitled to ask for an explanation I do not know that it is entitled to complain about the explanation that is given.


Some more gallery play.

Question No. 2
['An invitation was extended to the Right Hon. Harold Macmillan to visit Canada either before or after his visit to the United States in the latter part of April. He has accepted the invitation. Naturally there is a great field of matters that might be discussed on an occasion such as that. No agenda has been agreed on or has even been discussed as yet. However, I could think of many matters of interest to Canada, the United Kingdom and the commonwealth which would be subjects of discussion when that visit takes place. Indeed, the meeting together of prime ministers in this way is always extremely beneficial.']

1.	The Department of Mines and Technical Surveys is preparing to have drilled, in the near future, one or more core test holes in the general vicinity of Summerside, P.E.I., for the purpose of securing sub-surface geological information as an aid to determining the geological structure in this district.

2.	The drilling will be done by the Department of Public Works on behalf of the Department of Mines and Technical Surveys. It is expected that two or perhaps three drills will be operated. It is understood that each of these will require, in addition to a D.P.W. driller, a driller's helper and two to four labourers. The helpers and labourers will be hired locally.
3.	The project is being carried out under the federal government winter work program.
4.	During 1959, Imperial Oil Limited drilled three wells in search of oil in this general district. These were: (1) Imperial Wellington Station No. 1; (2) Imperial MacDougall No. 1; and (3) Imperial Port Hill No. 1.

Questions
With respect to the board of
broadcast governors I am advised that in answer to the first part of the question the board itself has made no surveys of the needs for television facilities in the electoral district of Skeena, nor is it aware of any specific surveys made by private operators.
With respect to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, I am advised that during 1961 the corporation did conduct a survey in the electoral district to determine the feasibility of providing television service to the communities of Prince Rupert, Kitimat and Terrace. A final decision has not been reached pending further study and evaluation of the C.B.C. engineering proposals, and an evaluation of a new proposal put forward by a private operator who has applied to the C.B.C. for network affiliation.
^ESCAPES FROM PENITENTIARIES


For each year since 1950, how many inmates, if any, have escaped from penitentiaries, and how many of the said escapees have been recaptured?


As the number of years and the statistics are fairly lengthy I suggest the answer might appear in Hansard, and I shall at once send a copy to the hon. member.


Agreed.
[Editor's note: The answer referred to above is as follows:]


\ Inmates recaptured
All recaptured
63 inmates recaptured
(8 inmates unlawfully at large)
Recaptured
Note: The above indicates the escapes during the period January 1 to December 31 of year indicated opposite number of inmates who escaped.
Questions
For each month since January 1, 1960, what was, in each of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police detachments in the Skeena electoral district, the number of Indians, as defined in the Indian Act, (a) charged with, and (b) convicted of, infractions of the sections of the Indian Act relating with intoxicants, and with respect to the convictions, what were the penalties imposed by number of Indians in each appropriate grouping of such penalties, and the total amount of fines levied?
Answer by: Mr. Fulton: By order in council dated March 18, 1888, the British Columbia government were given and assumed responsibility for the enforcement of the Indian Act and all other statutes, both federal and provincial, in connection with Indians in British Columbia. The situation, therefore, is that although the R.C.M. Police in British Columbia do carry out police functions in British Columbia under provincial authority they do so as the agents of the provincial government under contract. The particulars sought here do not fall within federal competence and accordingly the question should be directed to the government of British Columbia.


I would call the minister's attention to the fact that the question he has just answered is not marked with an asterisk and it is quite in order-in fact, it is contemplated-that the answers to these questions which do not bear an asterisk will simply be tabled.


I regret having taken up the time of the house unnecessarily, I think owing to my being the first one exposed to the new procedure.

Since September 13, 1961, what steps, if any, has
the emergency measures organization taken with respect to the planning and providing of reception facilities and shelters for those who would need them following their evacuation from their homes in the event of nuclear war?
[Mr. Fulton.j
Answer by: Mr. Diefenbaker: Planning and providing reception facilities and shelters for those who would need them following evacuation from their homes in the event of a nuclear war are, by agreement, primarily provincial and local responsibilities. The federal government provides help by way of advice, consultation, and financial support under the financial assistance program. Since September 13, 1961, these forms of federal assistance have been continued and emphasized. Certain aspects of the subject were reviewed at the conference on November 27, 1961, between federal and provincial ministers charged with responsibilities in civil emergency planning.


1.	Since September 13, 1961, has any contract been awarded for construction, at Arnprior, of a variety of prototype fall-out shelters, and, if so, what was the amount of the contract, and who was the person awarded the contract?
2.	Were there any other bidders, and, if so, what are their names, addresses, and amount of each bid?
3.	Have any of the said prototype shelters been completed, and, if so, how many, and what is considered to be the best type for each particular purpose for which such shelters are considered to be necessary?
4.	Have any steps been taken financially to assist our fellow Canadians to acquire such shelters, and, if so, what are the details?
Answer by: Mr. Diefenbaker:
1.	The contract was awarded October 23, 1961, for construction at Arnprior of a variety of prototype shelters. The amount of the contract was $24,473, and it was awarded to N. Sullivan and Son, Arnprior, Ontario.
2.	There was another bidder, M. G. Sulphur, Renfrew, Ontario, and the amount of that bid was $25,408.
3.	Three such prototype shelters have been completed except for a limited amount of internal fitting on which the work is now progressing. One of the shelters is of medium size, made of reinforced concrete, designed to accommodate some 30 persons and to give some protection against blast as well as fall-out. The second is of similar character except its capacity is limited to 5 or 6 persons, suitable for a family. The third is a below ground structure of family size, made from concrete blocks affording excellent fall-out protection, with limited protection against blast. Each of these is felt to be the best type for the particular purpose in mind.
4.	Yes. Persons wishing to construct shelters of this sort in their homes or on their premises may secure government guaranteed loans under the National Housing Act.


1.	Since September 13. 1961, how many federal buildings (a) have been considered to have adequate fall-out protection (b) can be improved to provide such protection, and what is the estimated cost of making such improvements and providing essential facilities and supplies (c) cannot be thus improved due to the excessive costs involved?
2.	Are steps being taken to so improve such buildings to provide adequate fall-out protection, and when is it estimated that this work will be completed?
3.	How many of the buildings referred to respectively in (a), (b), and (c) of part 1 of this question are in target cities?
4.	How many of the said buildings were considered to have been destroyed during exercise Tocsin B?
Answer by: Mr. Diefenbaker:
1.	During 1961 surveys of federal buildings with respect to fall-out protection have been carried out by two departments, the Department of Public Works and the Department of National Defence. Since the surveys by the Department of National Defence and the evaluation of them will not be completed until March 31, 1962, the information given here refers to the information gathered by the Department of Public Works only.
In its surveys it has been found that 504 federal buildings are considered to have adequate fall-out protection. In its opinion 324 additional buildings can be altered to provide adequate fall-out protection at an estimated cost of approximately $5,000,000 for the necessary improvements and essential facilities and supplies. Some 4,000 other federally owned buildings could only be provided with fall-out protection at considerably greater cost.
2.	The results of the detailed surveys described in 1 are at present under consideration and no decision to undertake construction has yet been made.
3.	Of the 828 federal buildings, including
the 504 with adequate fall-out protection and the 324 that could economically be modified, there are 281 in areas listed as possible target areas.	.
4.	Of these 828 buildings, it is estimated that 214 would have been destroyed under the circumstances assumed in exercise Tocsin B. No detailed review was made of the other buildings.


Since September 13, 1961, has the emergency measures organization, or any other part of government developed any measures to give priority to target areas for increasing fall-out protection for those dwelling in private houses or apartment houses by making it possible for people to make use of government, privately owned, commercial, and industrial buildings, and, if so, what are those measures?
Questions
Answer by: Mr. Diefenbaker: Since September 13,	1961, the emergency measures
organization, together with other agencies of government immediately concerned, such as the Department of Public Works, has been considering measures, with special attention to target areas, that would increase fall-out protection for those dwelling in private houses or apartment houses, by making it possible for people to use government, privately owned, commercial, and industrial buildings. Before firm recommendations can be made in this matter, it has been found necessary to procure a good deal of basic information. This includes the number of buildings that already have a reasonable degree of protection against radioactive fall-out, what buildings could economically be modified to afford such protection, what numbers of people under emergency conditions they would accommodate, what costs would be involved in improving the fall-out protection factor, and numerous other related facts.
While various buildings of the types enumerated above are subject to consideration, first priority has been given to federally owned buildings. The next group given attention includes those owned by provincial and municipal governments. Extensive surveys have been carried on by the Department of Public Works with respect to federally owned buildings and these surveys are supplemented by those now in progress by the Department of National Defence with respect to army buildings. Concurrently, provinces and municipalities have been encouraged to undertake sur veys of buildings they own. These surveys are now going forward at numerous points in Canada.
The federal government has provided technical advice and in some instances has provided personnel as well to assist in the surveys. The costs of such surveys made by provinces and municipalities are recognized as an appropriate part of the financial assistance program for emergency planning, and thus to the extent of 75 per cent are met from federal funds.
Beyond the buildings owned by various governments it would be anticipated that commercial and industrial buildings would fall into the next priority for survey purposes. When the degree of fall-out protection afforded by such buildings and their capacity for habitation for survival purposes have been determined, then measures for possible use of such buildings in an emergency can be given detailed consideration.

1.	Since the announcement in the house on May 12, 1961, of the subsidy for the construction

of ships, how many contracts have been entered into between the Canadian maritime commission, the ship builder, and the ship owner?
2.	How many such contracts are for (a) operation in the deep-sea trade (b) operation in the lake and coastal trade (c) trawlers and fishing vessels?
3.	In what shipyards are these being built?
4.	How many such ships were contracted for with the shipyards prior to (a) May 12, 1961 (b) since May 12, 1961, and before September 27, 1961, (c) since September 27, 1961?
5.	How many such applications are for (a) operation in the deep-sea trade (b) operation in the lake and coastal trade (c) trawlers and fishing vessels?


Mr. Speaker, the answer to this question is as follows:
As it is not possible at the present time to answer specifically each part of this question, I would like to deal with it as a whole.
I might first say that contracts are not entered into between the Canadian maritime commission and the owners. What is negotiated between the commission, the owners and the builders is an agreement which covers the payment of subsidy for a specific project. The agreement can be signed only after all matters associated with the application for the subsidy have been settled, and it has not been possible up to now for the commission to complete the required detailed arrangements. Actual agreements not having yet been signed, it is considered that names of shipyards and shipowners concerned should be withheld pending formal execution of agreements.
Up to the present 79 applications have been reported to the commission in respect of vessels which could come under the subsidy. The value of such construction amounts to approximately $75,000,000, and the work is being carried out in some 30 different shipyards throughout the country.
Of the applications before the commission, 5 are for passenger and cargo vessels, 17 dry cargo, 4 oil tankers, 15 tugs, 24 barges, 11 fishing vessels and 3 miscellaneous.


What was the net amount, exclusive of loans. If any, from the treasury, In the unemployment Insurance fund, at the latest available date, with securities held, quoted:	(a) at par (b) at their

1.	Are trailers now being used at D.E.W. line points shortly to become surplus equipment?
Questions
2,	If so, how soon will these trailers become available for disposal, and at what price?


Mr. Speaker, the answer to this question is as follows:
1.	Crown Assets Disposal Corporation is not informed in advance of the nature or quantity of equipment to be declared surplus by the United States government the owner of the equipment mentioned.
2.	When and if such equipment is reported surplus and is accepted for disposal by the corporation, acting as agent of the United States government, it will be sold to the highest bidder in accordance with corporation practices.


1.	Do present coastal traffic regulations permit only vessels built and owned in Canada?
2.	If so, what is the position of boats built years ago in other countries which have been operating on the great lakes for many years by various owners?


Mr. Speaker, the answer to this question is as follows:
1.	No. In accordance with the commonwealth merchant shipping agreement and the Canada Shipping Act, ships on commonwealth registry may engage in the coasting trade of Canada.
2.	Ships operating on British registry but built outside the commonwealth, in order to engage in the coasting trade of Canada, must obtain a licence from the Minister of National Revenue obtainable on payment of a 25 per cent ad valorem duty.
unemployment benefit recipients

Mr. Speaker, the answers to the three parts of this question are as follows:

3.	The commission's decision reads as follows:
The law is quite clear on the point that an unincorporated association is not a legal entity and that a member of such a society cannot be employed under a contract of service by the association of which he is a member, since he is individually as much the employer as every other member and therefore cannot also be the employee of the association under a contract of service which requires the relationship of master and servant between two different persons.
I might add that when the union was advised of this ruling by the commission it was also informed that, if desired, an appeal could be made to the umpire who is the final authority under the Unemployment Insurance Act.

1.	Have any requests been received from, or have any discussions taken place with (a) the governments of Alberta or the United States of America (b) private oil companies, concerning the explosion of a nuclear device in the Athabasca tar sands in Alberta?
2.	If so, on what dates, and what was the federal government's answer in each case?
Answer by: Mr. Churchill: The possibility of recovering oil from Athabasca tar sands by the explosion of a nuclear device was brought to the attention of several federal government organizations by a private oil company in 1958. As a result, the former minister of mines and technical surveys set up a committee to investigate the technical feasibility of this proposal. This committee was composed of technical representatives from the oil company and federal and Alberta government organizations and it had discussions with technical officers of the United States atomic energy commission, who had carried out underground tests in that country.
Though there have been discussions on the technical level regarding the feasibility of such an experiment, there have been no formal discussions with the governments of Alberta or the United States of America regarding the actual carrying out of an explosion in the Alberta tar sands. The Prime Minister advised, in answer to a question on March 21, 1960-Hansard, p. 2251-that the atomic energy control board, which would have to approve such an experiment, had not received any application for permission to carry out any such explosion. This is still the situation.
