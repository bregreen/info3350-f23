The government has now received a reply to its letter to the Secretary General of the United Nations. I should like to table copies. In view of the interest shown in this subject I wonder whether the house would wish to have this reply, together with the original letter which was tabled in the House of Commons earlier, printed as an appendix to Hansard.


Does the house wish these documents to be printed? Is it agreed?


Agreed.
[Editor's Note: For text of letters referred to above, see appendix.]


Officials of Atomic Energy of Canada Limited and the French Commissariat a PEnergie Atomique have for some time been engaged in discussions in order to work out satisfactory arrangements for the sale to France of plutonium produced in the Canadian nuclear power reactors at Rolphton and Douglas Point, Ontario. These arrangements have been completed and have now been approved by both the government of France and the government of Canada.
The French Commissariat a l'Energie Atomique has undertaken intensive research in the development of plutonium burning, fast breeder, nuclear power reactors. Although France is able to fill some of her requirements for plutonium domestically, additional quantities are required in order not to delay the development program. Current Canadian programs, on the other hand, do not fully utilize the plutonium being produced in our reactors. Discussions between the French Commissariat and A.E.C.L. on the possible
supply of plutonium from Canada, therefore, came as a natural outcome of the collaboration between the two government agencies.
It is a long standing policy of the Canadian government that nuclear materials be exported from Canada for peaceful purposes only. With the full agreement of the French government it has been decided that the plutonium which will be used in the French civil nuclear program will be transferred to France under the provisions of the agreement between Canada and the European Atomic Energy Community, of which France is of course a member. This agreement provides for the application of EURATGM safeguards, and for procedures whereby Canada may obtain assurance that the Community's safeguards and control system is satisfactory and effective for any material transferred under the agreement from Canada to the member states of EUR ATOM. The role is fully compatible with Canada's signature of the test ban treaty and of the NPT.
I	should also like to point out that the agreement concluded between Canada and India in 1963 regarding the construction of a nuclear power station in Rajasthan, India, similar to the Douglas Point nuclear power station, provided for reciprocal bilateral safeguards on the Rajasthan and Douglas Point nuclear power stations and any special nuclear materials produced in them. The government of India has therefore been consulted regarding the safeguards arrangements to be applied on transfers to France of plutonium produced in the Douglas Point nuclear power station.
Mr. R. Gordon L. Fairweather (Fundy
Royal): The statement just made by the Secretary of State for External Affairs is interesting. It would be better, of course, if spokesmen for other parties had been given some warning so that useful comment could be made.
I am sure this party is delighted to know that emphasis has been placed on non-military use, and also that there is provision for full inspection. I hope France has been urged to sign the non-proliferation treaty.


Mr. Speaker, we should simply like to congratulate the government on having taken

September 30, 1968
Proposed Legislation
a firm stand in connection with these arrangements, namely its insistence on the provision that the plutonium we are to export will be used for peaceful purposes only.
While I am on my feet I think it might be useful to suggest once more to this minister and to all ministers that when statements of this nature are to be made on motions it would be an act of courtesy if copies were provided to spokesmen of opposition parties.
[DOT] (2:40 p.m.)


Mr. Speaker, we are happy also to hear the minister's statement to the effect that the plutonium transaction with France has been concluded. It is true that, for some years, the Canadian government's policy had been to refrain from any transaction if that metal was to be used for war purposes. But since the French government gave the assurance that this plutonium will be used for peaceful purposes, in France as well as throughout the world, I feel that the Canadian government deserves to be congratulated on its firm stand.
Like those who spoke before me, I would ask the minister concerned and his cabinet colleagues to let us know before hand when they have important announcements to make to the house in order that we may be able to express more easily that we have to say on those various subjects.

(Questions answered orally are indicated by an asterisk.)
1.	Does the Department of Agriculture pay an export incentive subsidy to cheese producers in Canada?
2.	If so, what was the total amount paid in each province in the last three years?


1.	No. The Canadian Dairy Commission pays an export subsidy on Cheddar cheese exported to Britain through its export equalization fund established by a deduction from the direct milk subsidy payments made to producers of manufacturing milk in Canada.
2.	Export subsidies on cheese for the past three years totalled:	1965-66,	$1,065,492;
1966-67, $1,349,731; 1967-68, $1,554,300.
Export statistics are maintained on a national basis only and it is not possible to identify the province of origin of the cheese exported. It is estimated, however, that approximately 25 per cent of the cheddar chese exported to Britain is of Quebec manufacture and the balance mainly from Ontario.

from the Cabin Tent and Portable Cottage Association and/or the Provincial Government of Saskatchewan requesting that the order made to discontinue shack tents and portable cottages of the Prince Albert National Park in the National Park should be revoked?
2.	Will the government give reconsideration to the decision made in this regard?


1. Yes. The members of this association have expressed concern lest the department revoke annual permits and summarily evict their members from the park. Nothing can be further from the truth. The department has not issued any such order. Effective May 1 new permits will not be issued for cabin tents but all persons who held permits in 1967 will be permitted to renew these annually for as long as they desire. The purpose is to permit long range development of prime public lands occupying the best beach areas in the park for the benefit of all visitors.

Questions

September 30, 1968


1.	What are the lengths of the longest runways at Gander, Halifax, Montreal, Toronto, Winnipeg, Calgary, Edmonton and Vancouver airports?
2.	Has the Department of Transport carried out studies to determine which, if any, of the above airports could accommodate supersonic transports thereinafter referred to as SST's) ?
3.	If so, what are the results of such studies with regard to (a) length of runways, and (b) weightcarrying capacities, of each airport?
4.	Who is carrying out the SST studies by the Department, and approximately how much money is being spent on same?
5.	Do such studies consider the noise nuisances created by SST's, and methods of overcoming the same?
6.	If the noise level is considered excessive to humans and domestic and wild life (a) is the Department considering the location of SST airfields where such nuisance would have a minimum effect, or (b) is it considering a legislative ban on flights, because of such circumstances?
7.	When are SST's expected to be ready for regular commercial travel?
8.	What is the average amount of time that is taken in Canada to develop new airports, or to make drastic alterations to older ones (with examples) ?


1. Gander (8,900 feet), Halifax (8,800 feet), Montreal (11,000 feet), Toronto (11,050 feet), Winnipeg (11,000 feet), Calgary (12,675 feet), Edmonton (11,000 feet) and Vancouver (10,600 feet).
2.	Yes.
3.	(a) Preliminary manufacturer's performance specifications indicate that sea-level runway lengths of 10,500 feet (Concorde) and 7,650 feet (Boeing 2707) would be required when operating at maximum gross take off weights.
(b) With respect to weight loadings not all runways and taxiways at the specified airports would be capable of handling SST aircraft, however, each of the eight airports has at least one runway and adequate connecting taxiways to permit SST operations.
4.	A Department of Transport Air Services SST study group, in consort with the air services aviation systems planning group, is monitoring all developments of the SST programs and adapting Department of Transport planning techniques and philosophies to meet the emerging requirements. Consultations with major air carriers and manufacturers are held on a regular basis for exchange
[Mr. Kierans.l
and coordination of all pertinent information. Canada is also represented on the International Civil Aviation Organization technical panel on supersonic transport operations by an official member from the Department of Transport.
No direct expenditures are incurred by these studies. Members of the study teams are regular air services employees.
5.	Yes. This is an international problem being studied vigorously by all concerned. In the Department of Transport a sonic boom/noise "subcommittee" of the SST study group is engaged in continuing studies related to the over-all assessment of these problems.
6.	Considerable research is being conducted in the United States and United Kingdom on the physiological effects of noise and sonic-boom overpressures on human and animal life. These and many other studies are being closely monitored by the SST study group subcommittee on sonic boom/noise.
(a)	Locating SST airports in remote areas would certainly be given consideration if results of the research studies suggested this course of action. Hopefully, technological advances will preclude this necessity.
(b)	The Department of Transport has every intention of protecting citizens, animal life, and property from any inherent dangers associated with the noise and sonic-boom phenomena generated by SST aircraft. Under the authority of The Aeronautics Act (part I) a regulation has already been promulgated which states that "No aircraft shall be flown in such a manner as to create a shock wave, the effect of which is to create or likely to create a hazard to other aircraft or to persons or property on the ground." (The air regulations, part V, para. 515.(c))
7.	As near as can be determined the Concorde would enter commercial service in early 1972 and the Boeing 2707 in late 1976.
8.	Airports range in size and complexity from a simple, small, single runway to a sophisticated international airport with a complex and intricate system of runways and facilities. The former could take up to two years to complete from land acquisition to completion, while the latter could require anywhere from five to seven years. Pitt Meadows, B.C. fits into the first category (two years) and Edmonton international airport the second category (seven years). On the other hand Toronto and Montreal international airports as well as other major airports are constantly undergoing changes, alterations and
September 30, 1968

modifications to keep pace with the unprecedented growth rate of passenger and air cargo traffic.

of the Bank of Western Canada held on September 14, 1987 voted in favour of winding up the Bank. A winding up order pursuant to the provisions of the Winding-up Act was issued by the Manitoba Court of Queen's Bench on October 30, 1967 and the Clarkson Company appointed as liquidator. On February 1, 1968, the liquidator made a payment to shareholders of $13 per share. On August 14, 1968 it was announced that the liquidator expected to make a final payment to shareholders in October 1968 and that the expected amount of that payment was between $1.60 and $1.75 per share.
2.	As indicated in the answer to question number 1, the Bank of Western Canada is still in the process of liquidation. The Bank Act is the charter of each bank named in schedule A of that Act. The name of a bank remains in schedule A until it is removed by act of parliament. If a bank's capital has been returned to its shareholders in the process of liquidation, in view of the provisions of section 37 of the Bank Act, such a bank would be unable to use its charter without specific government authorization.


1.	What is the present status of plans to develop housing on the approximately one thousand acres at Malvern in Scarborough Township on the property acquired by the federal-provincial partnership in 1953 for housing?
2.	Have definite plans been made for provision of services and on what date is it anticipated that the actual housing will be built and available for occupation?
3.	Are any of the houses to be made available to Ontario Housing Corporation or other authorities for public housing?


1.	Following a feasibility study, sponsored jointly by the federal-provincial partners in 1967, consultants were appointed in March 1968 to prepare a development plan for the Malvern Lands. Provided a plan of subdivision can be registered by mid-1969 it is expected that the installation of services will be underway by the end of that year.
2.	The appointed consultants have responsibility for the design of services and supervision of their installation, the timing of which is covered in 1 above. Actual house construction will follow immediately on the installation of services.
3.	Yes.

On the orders of the day:
Mr. Speaker, in view of reports that the United States has asked its allies to increase their defence budgets I should like to ask the Secretary of State for External Affairs whether any such request has been made of Canada. If so, what has been the reply of the Canadian government?


Mr. Speaker, as Secretary

of State for External Affairs I received a note from the Secretary of State of the United States at the end of the week in which the United States expressed its views concerning what should be an adequate response by the NATO allies to the invasion of Czechoslovakia. There was also a comment in particular about the kind of response they would like Canada to make. No reply has as yet been made. I doubt very much whether a reply will be formally made.
All these matters are to be discussed at the NATO council. At that time Canada will indicate its general position.


I should like to ask, simply for clarification, whether the Secretary of State for External Affairs is not prepared at this time to say what are the suggestions of the United States with regard to this matter.


No, Mr. Speaker. I expect that as matters develop there will be an opportunity to be more specific about Canada's plans, but at the moment we have simply received these representations from the United States and they are under study. I do not think it would be appropriate for me to reveal them at the moment. They were presented to us in the form of a general view of the United States that there should be a firm response from the NATO allies to the invasion of Czechoslovakia.


After the government has had an opportunity to consider the request will the Secretary of State for External Affairs be prepared to make a statement on this matter, giving the house this information?


At the appropriate time, when the government has reached a conclusion as to the general plans, I am sure the house would expect me to reveal them and would expect that indeed there would be some debate on the matter.

Inquiries of the Ministry


Mr. Speaker, may I ask the Secretary of State for External Affairs whether the report is correct that he will not be attending the meeting of the NATO foreign ministers? If that is correct, who will represent Canada?


Order. The hon. member knows he must ask the question directly, and must not ask the minister to either confirm or deny a report.


May I ask whether the minister intends to be at the NATO foreign ministers conference which has now been called.


The meeting which is to be held in New York is a meeting of the foreign ministers who will be in New York to attend the United Nations general assembly. Unfortunately the invitation I received was for a day for which I had made a prior engagement some months ago. I felt that I could not break this engagement because of the inconvenience I would thus cause to a great many people. However, I shall have an opportunity later to discuss with the same foreign ministers the subjects which will then be under discussion.


Will the Secretary of State for External Affairs be represented at this meeting of NATO, and if so by Whom?


Mr. Speaker, I am not certain this will be necessary. This is not a meeting of NATO; it is a dinner being put on by Dean Rusk of the United States to which he has invited the foreign ministers who happen to be there, but not all of us will be there.


On the orders of the day:
Mr. Speaker, in view of the Prime Minister's announcement that he is willing to make aircraft available for relief aid to Biafra, I should like to ask the Secretary of State for External Affairs to outline the conditions under which the Canadian government will make these aircraft available?


Mr. Speaker, perhaps I could best answer by reading from the press release issued today as a result of my meeting with General Wrinch of the Canadian Red
[Mr. Sharp.)
Cross, held at the end of the week. In that press release I said:
-the government was prepared to facilitate these relief operations by providing a Canadian forces Hercules aircraft and crew to the Canadian Red Cross for participation as soon as practicable in relief operations in areas under the control of the Nigerian government.


Mr. Speaker, since these voluntary organizations have raised supplies and money, and in view of the fact that the major problem seems to involve the cost of paying for these aircraft, is the Canadian government prepared to finance the use of the Hercules aircraft?


Mr. Speaker, I made it quite plain that the Canadian government is prepared to provide a Hercules aircraft for use in Nigerian territory.


Mr. Speaker, I should like to ask the minister whether the Canadian Red Cross made any request to the government for assistance in their efforts to get relief supplies into the area of Nigeria that is controlled by the Biafrans.


Mr. Speaker, in answer to that particular question I will give you the relevant sentence.


How about making a statement on motions and dealing with this properl
