Mr. Speaker, in the absence of the Secretary of State for External Affairs (Mr. Sharp) who would normally report to the house on the spring NATO ministerial session, and because there has been a great deal of interest regarding this particular session, I have undertaken on his behalf to make the following report to hon. members of this house.
With your permission, Mr. Speaker, I should like to table copies in English and French of the communique which was issued at the conclusion of the regular spring meeting of ministers which I attended in Washington last Thursday and Friday with the Secretary of State for External Affairs.
Part of the Washington meeting was devoted to commemorating NATO's twentieth anniversary but the ministers showed little inclination to dwell on the past accomplishments of the alliance. Their attention was focused instead on problems of the future, both immediate and long term.
The immediate issue was to decide how to get on with the resolution of east-west problems. Soviet intervention in Czechoslovakia had set back hopes for improving east-west relations, but there was agreement in Washington that a continuing dialogue between members of NATO and the Warsaw Pact was the only rational course. NATO's 15 member governments therefore agreed on a policy of gradually renewing contacts with the Warsaw Pact countries and of exploring all possibilities for negotiations that might help resolve their outstanding differences with the east.
The ministers discussed at some length the proposal for a European security conference contained in the communique issued by the Warsaw Pact in Budapest on March 17. The
conclusion was that a European security conference as conceived in the Budapest declaration posed serious difficulties, because the proposed terms of reference called for recognizing the continued division of Germany and existing borders in central Europe. To accept in advance the Communist position on these issues would clearly pre-judge the outcome of the conference. A number of the delegations in Washington, including that of Canada, considered that if the east was now seriously interested in the possibility of holding a European security conference, they might be prepared to accept realistic terms of reference. The NATO ministers agreed steps should be taken to test thoroughly the intentions of the eastern European countries, particularly on issues which might be negotiable. There was general agreement that if a conference were held it should include both the United States and Canada.

At the Washington meeting a significant new dimension was added to the ministers' discussions. It was the question of what the members of the alliance might do collectively to assist in the search for solutions of the social problems facing modern societies and in the attempt to close the gap between the properous developed countries and those of the developing world. It was acknowledged that many aspects of these questions were already being considered in other international bodies but there was a general disposition to see if NATO could help to find new and better ways of sharing views and experiences on them.
The Canadian delegation's principal aim was to ensure that NATO would use to the full its capacity to contribute to the early improvement of east-west relations. The paper on east-west relations which the ministers had before them was based on a Canadian draft and its conclusions were largely reflected in the results of the meeting.
[DOT] (2:10 p.m.)

In the main Canadian statement which was delivered by the Secretary of State for External Affairs, emphasis was placed not only on

April 14, 1969
NATO Report
east-west relations generally, but on the importance we attach to the early initiation of talks between the United States and the Soviet Union on the limitation of offensive and defensive strategic nuclear weapons. The Secretary of Staite for External Affairs also expressed our hope that, once begun, these talks would be pursued, despite any temporary setbacks on other fronts. He joined other spokesmen in welcoming the United States government's willingness to enter into bilateral negotiations with the Soviet Union on a number of world problems, including the limitation of nuclear arms, and the United States pledge to consult its partners as these negotiations progress.

The Secretary of State for External Affairs underlined the importance which Canada attaches to including China in any attempts to settle major world problems. He informed the meeting of the steps taken thus far toward establishing diplomatic relations with the Peking government and that we have now had a response from the Chinese, indicating their willingness to enter into substantive discussions. These will be taking place in Stockholm through the two embassies with our embassy reinforced as necessary by sending officials from Ottawa. The expectation is that these discussions will get underway in about a month's time. There is no indication of how long this will take. We are anxious for them to succeed, but they will be essentially confidential and are not likely to be helped if carried out under the glare of constant publicity.

The Secretary of State for External Affairs and I used the occasion of the meeting to explain to our allies the outcome of our defence policy review as it will affect our approach to NATO in the future. We confirmed Canada's intention to remain in the alliance and informed the members of the decision to embark on a planned and phased reduction of the size of the Canadian forces now stationed in Europe. We explained that in carrying out this decision, the government intended to consult closely with Canada's allies. The purpose of consultation would be to enable us to take account of the views of our allies as plans are made regarding the nature and the timing of the reduction of our forces in Europe and the extent and location of Canada's continuing military contribution to NATO. The Secretary of State for External

Affairs stated that account would also be taken of any international developments which might have a bearing on the balance of security in Europe and elsewhere.
A number of the ministers referred specifically to Canada's recent decision. While they welcomed our intention to remain in the alliance, they expressed the hope that the decision to reduce our forces in Europe would not be carried out in such a way as to jeopardize the security of the alliance or the prospects for east-west negotiations. With these considerations in mind, they welcomed our undertaking to consult them on our plans.


Mr. Speaker, I think it is rather a pity that this is the first opportunity we have had in parliament to discuss this new policy of the government-whatever it may be-which was announced the day after the house recessed. Quite apart from any personal opinion I might hold in this regard, I think it would be rather difficult for the government to persuade the people of this country that the step taken, as announced on the day after the house recessed, did not demonstrate considerable contempt for this ancient institution.
I really feel for the minister who has just spoken because it must have been rather difficult for him to carry this message to Washington and to attempt to explain to our NATO allies the Prime Minister's policy in respect of defence-whatever that policy might be. We cannot help but feel this way on the twentieth anniversary of the establishment of NATO, a time that reminds us of the part Canada played in the establishment, the foundation and the development of this alliance.
I agree of course that the immediate issue was to decide how to get on with the resolution of east-west problems. I agree with that wholeheartedly. I agree of course that the ministers were wise to explore to the full the possibility of the countries of the east being serious with regard to the detente. The fact that this should be the theme of this meeting of NATO ministers emphasizes to all of us how inappropriate was the decision of the government of Canada to announce on the eve of that meeting its decision to reduce its support of the NATO alliance, and thereby to that extent-which is to a considerable extent-reduce and weaken the position from which the NATO countries would be conducting any such negotiation with the countries of the east.


Hear, hear.
April 14, 1969


Mr. Speaker, I understand from the statement of the minister that he and his colleagues explained to the representatives of our allies in Washington precisely what was meant by the proposed planned and phased reduction of the size of our Canadian forces in Europe. I wonder if he left them as much in the dark as we have been left on this subject. I do not believe any member of the opposition at least has the haziest notion of what planned and phased reduction is in process. We do not know whether the words used by the Prime Minister are words of political compromise or whether they cover up a serious intention and plan to change the role of Canada, as we in this party have made clear from time to time we believe it should be changed.
I suggest to the government that it is time not just to talk about a phase two, but to let the country into its confidence as to precisely what it has in mind and to consult parliament about this. The Prime Minister has made a statement which has been heralded as a

April 14. 1969
NATO Report
highly important and deep seated review of a crucial phase of our foreign and external policy. This was done the day after parliament adjourned. Here we are back again today and the Minister of National Defence makes a statement in which he says that he informed our allies, but he did nothing to inform this house about the crucial details. I was pleased, as I am sure other members of the house were, to find that in the consultations at NATO there seems to have been a new emphasis on the manner of organizing a detente. We in this party warmly welcome that because we want to make it perfectly clear that in our view NATO cannot continue to have the loyalty and credibility of its member nations unless it ceases to be merely a bureaucratic military alliance continuing policies that were appropriate in the past and that are no longer appropriate at the present time.
I am inclined to regret that the proposal for a European security conference seems to have been pushed aside, although perhaps that is wrong and it is really to be explored. May I say that we in this party will give our warmest support to anything that this government does while it is a member within NATO to see that NATO is used for the purpose of organizing and arranging a new security system in Europe.
To end these remarks, may I express the hope that the minister's announcement is only a brief prelude to a full discussion both in this house and in the defence committee of the urgent defence and external affairs policies which call for decision at the present time.


Mr. Speaker, my remarks concerning the statement made by the Minister of National Defence (Mr. Cadieux) will be rather brief.
I wish to thank the minister for sending me a little in advance a copy of this statement, but I would like to point out to him, however, that it was drafted only in English. Nevertheless he did take the trouble to give us a few extracts in French and the interpreters did the rest.
I am happy, as everyone is, to find out that following this conference commemorating NATO's twentieth anniversary, steps have been taken to continue or intensify negotiations in order to improve, if possible, through NATO, the security of Europe.

As far as am concerned', I believe that as long as there are negotiations, as long as there is a dialogue, one can hope for improvements in the existing differences. However, I still have a doubt, because if we consider the billions of dollars the existing powers are spending year after year for armaments, we can but ask ourselves whether this is serious. For instance if we look at the statistics for the year 1967, we shall see that in the countries we know approximately $6 billions have been spent on depelopment work and $150 billions on armaments. And when one spends 25 times more on armaments than on development, one must ask oneself if this is logical and what one is after, on the Warsaw Pact side as on the NATO side.
Mr. Speaker, the minister tells us that other matters were discussed, such as the external aid the member countries of NATO can provide.
I believe that we could do a lot more by reducing arms expenditures, by increasing our assistance to the developing countries, and by helping the European countries to pursue their development and to meet their own needs.
And that is why, Mr. Speaker, I agree that Canada should continue her contribution to NATO, but recall her troops home as soon as possible. If necessary, she can, at a given time, contribute to the defence of Europe.
I conclude my remarks by saying, as did the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Stanfield) at the beginning of his observations, that the brief statement made this afternoon is far from completing the one made after the adjournment for Easter. I hope, Mr. Speaker, that we will get the chance, very soon, to discuss and study in detail our participation to the defence of Europe, to NORAD and to the defence of the free world in general.
[DOT] (2:30 p.m.)


that the third report of the Standing Committee on National Resources and Public Works, presented to the house on Tuesday, April 1, be concurred in.


Motion agreed to.
April 14, 1969
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of privilege affecting this chamber. Your Honour will recall that on April 2, the day on which we adjourned for the Easter recess, I rose to protest the fact that the Prime Minister (Mr. Trudeau) did not then present the decision of the government regarding its review of defence policy, a decision that we were told had to be made public by April 10. Within 24 hours of the adjournment the Prime Minister did make such a statement outside the House of Commons.
There is no sense threshing over past affairs, but I rise now to protest just as vigorously the fact that the Prime Minister did not even find it necessary to rise in his place today and table the document which he presented to the press outside this chamber on Thursday, April 3. It seems to me that at least he should have had concern enough for the work of this parliament to want to make a very important document, one perhaps even more important in his mind than in the minds of some of us, part of our parliamentary work, part of Hansard, Votes and Proceedings or what not.
This is another example of-as I called it on April 2-the cavalier treatment of this house by the Prime Minister who, I repeat did not find it necessary at least to do what is demanded of a Prime Minister-that an important document given to the press be placed before this House of Commons with some explanation as to what it meant, so that there could be a minimum of discussion of what the government presented on Thursday, April 3 after parliament adjourned. I can find no words strong enough to condemn that kind of treatment of the House of Commons by the Prime Minister.


Order, please. Perhaps if it is the wish of the house the Prime Minister may be allowed to reply. But at the same time, in my view, the hon. member for York South has raised a grievance rather than a question of privilege. In any event, his point was not followed by a motion and I do not think the matter should now be the subject of a debate. In view of this I would think it might be inadvisable to have a debate of any nature, even by way of a statement by the Prime Minister.
Questions
I hope hon. members will agree with my suggestion that in view of the fact that there is not, in my opinion, a question of privilege here, and particularly since the point raised by the hon. member for York South has not been followed by a motion, there is no question before the house and there should not be a debate at this time.


(Questions answered orally are indicated by an asterisk)
1.	Does the government intend to set up a program of English or French courses for employees in federal departments and, if so, when will these courses begin?
2.	If not, does the government intend to make a study on the subject?


am informed by the Public Service Commission as follows: 1. The government, in 1963, authorized language training courses in the French and English languages (as second languages) for employees in the Public Service. These courses began early in 1964 and the number of such courses has been systematically increased as teaching resources became available in Ottawa and other major centres across Canada where the need for second language skills has been identified. These courses are operated under the jurisdiction of the Public Service Commission and are available to selected employees in all government departments and agencies and in a number of Crown corporations.

Questions
that: 1. The Canadian Corporation for the 1967 World Exhibition, and not the three governments, met the cost of the Expo Express. The cost of any single item purchased by the Corporation has never been allocated among the three governments. The total cost of the equipment, design and installation of the mass transit system (Expo Express) as reported in the fifth annual report, page 48, schedule 5, was $13,418,848.
2.	Yes. The Canadian Corporation for the 1967 World Exhibition sold the Expo Express to the Society Urbaine des Transports Rapides Inc. (SUTRI) for $1,880,000. In turn, Sutri sold the Expo Express to the City of Montreal for their acquisition price i.e. $1,880,000.
3.	No.


1.	For what reason is the Dominion Bureau of Statistics still using the 1935-39 base for computing the index for farm product prices, when the base year has been revised more than once for most other price index reports?
2.	Is consideration being given to up-dating the farm price index to make it comparable with other price reports?


The Dominion Bureau of Statistics reports that: 1 and 2. The main reason for the index of farm products still being on the 1935-39 base was the priority assigned to the revision of the index of farm production. The revision of the index of farm product prices is now under way and it is expected that a series based on 1961 = 100 will be published by September of this year.


1.	Is the Canadian Government Travel Bureau planning an advertising campaign in the United States designed to promote increased travel to the Atlantic Provinces?
2.	If so, what is the name of the Canadian advertising agency entrusted with the responsibility of directing this campaign?
3.	What amount has been paid, or is to be paid, to the agency for the purpose of buying television time in the United States?
4.	Has said agency sub-contracted to any other advertising agency in the United States or Canada the job of buying such television time?

5.	If so, what is the name of such Canadian or American agency, and on what basis was selection for sub-contracting made?


1. Yes.
2.	Stanfield, Johnson and Hill Limited.
3.	To be paid in 1969, $168,000.
4.	No. But Stanfield, Johnson and Hill Limited has bought the TV time concerned through a media buying service in New York City (not an advertising agency). No extra costs were involved in using this service, either to Stanfield, Johnson and Hill Limited or to the Canadian Government Travel Bureau. (The media buying service receives its compensation by purchasing block time at preferential rates and selling (portions of it) it for use by advertisers at rates sufficiently higher to realize a profit on operations.)
5.	RDR Associates, N.Y. City. The selection was based on advice from Lennen & Newell Inc. (The United States associate of Stanfield, Johnson and Hill Limited.) and as a result of a study by Stanfield, Johnson & Hill Ltd. on methods of buying TV spot time. This study which examined alternative firms and methods, including test comparisons of comparable buys, showed that the most efficient method of buying time required for the campaign was by utilizing a media buying service.


1.	What amount was spent by the federal government for university grants in Prince Edward Island for each of the fiscal years from 1964-65 to 1968-69 inclusive?
2.	What amount is estimated to be spent for university grants in Prince Edward Island in the fiscal year 1969-70 and is this amount included in the amounts proposed to be spent under the Comprehensive Development Plan?


I am informed by the Departments of the Secretary of State and Regional Economic Expansion as follows:
1.	and 2. From 1964-65 to 1966-67 federal University Grants were paid on a per capita basis ($2 per capita of provincial population in 1964-65 and 1965-66, and a national average of $5 per capita of population in 1966-67), through the Association of Universities and Colleges of Canada, to the two eligible institutions in Prince Edward Island.
April 14, 1969

Payments of University Grants were: 196465, $214,000; 1965-66, $216,000; 1966-67, $557,000.
The University Grants program was terminated March 31, 1967. Therefore, since that date there has been no federal program for direct support of universities. However, under Part II of the Federal-Provincial Fiscal Arrangements Act 1967, which came into force April 1, 1967, Canada transfers fiscal resources to the provincial governments to assist them in meeting the rising costs of post-secondary (including university) education generally. The extent to which these transferred resources are used by the provinces for the support of universities is, of course, a matter for provincial authorities to decide. The value of these transfers under Part II of the Federal-Provincial Fiscal Arrangements Act, 1967 (consisting of tax abatements of 4 percent of individual income tax and 1 percent of corporation taxable income, and cash adjustment payments) to the government of the Province of Prince Edward Island is estimated at $1,635,000 for 1967-68 and $2,049,000 for 1968-69. For 1969-70 it is forecast that this figure will further increase to about $2.56 million. These estimated and forecast amounts are, of course, subject to adjustment when final audited data are available on postsecondary education operating costs, and final values of tax abatements are calculated. These amounts are not included under the Comprehension Development Plan.

Is it government policy to require the Post Office Department to cover its costs and, if so, does the government intend to amend Section 17 of the Post Office Act so that the Governor General, the House of Commons, the Senate and departments of government are no longer exempt from postage?


In so far as the Post Office Department is concerned: Ultimately, it is the intention to place the Post Office Department on a balanced budget. While there are no immediate plans for amending Section 17
of the Post Office Act, the value of the free postage privileges afforded under this section is regarded as postal revenue in the Department's annual statement of revenues and expenditures as shown in the Postmaster General's Report.


Since 1947, what amount was paid each year by the federal government to each of the provinces in connection with the transfer of the income tax of public utility companies (electricity, gas and steam) and in this regard have the provinces requested the inclusion of telephone companies?

1.	Does the Department of Energy, Mines and Resources plan to study pollution conditions on the Lower Fraser River as they relate to (a) the effects of raw sewage on the pollution of the Fraser (b) the upward movement of effluent resulting from incoming tides (c) the effectiveness of primary treatment (d) the percentage of pollution caused by industrial wastes (e) the costs to private industry of eliminating industrial waste from the River?
2.	What other research into effects of primary treatment is now being carried out in Canada?
3.	Does the federal government now have an anti-pollution pilot project underway in British Columbia and, if so, where?


1. Water pollution control and abatement is primarily a provincial responsibility. The federal government is directly involved where pollution affects international waters, transport, fisheries or wildlife; and it also undertakes and coordinates essential water quality and pollution abatement research. The Canada Centre
April 14, 1S69



for Inland Waters established by the Department of Energy, Mines and Resources will be a focal point for such research.
Federal government activity in the study of specific pollution problems normally is in cooperation with the appropriate provincial government. The Department of Energy, Mines and Resources has no plans at this time for a study of pollution conditions on the lower Fraser River directly related to the five items, (a) to (e), mentioned in the Question. The Department now is operating eight permanent water quality monitoring stations on the Fraser River and its tributaries, and plans to place seven additional stations in operation in 1969; it also will extend its analysis procedures to include pollution parameters representative of sewage waste discharges in the Fraser River system.
2.	Virtually all studies of river pollution are directed to some extent to the evaluation of the effects of waste discharges, whether or not they are subject to treatment. Research into various elements of the effects of primary treatment of municipal and/or industrial waste discharges is being carried out by federal and provincial government agencies, universities, industries and consultants.
3.	The Department has no specific antipollution pilot project under way in British Columbia at present; but negotiations are in progress for a comprehensive federal-provincial study of the water needs of the Okanagan River basin, and this study will include examination of pollution abatement requirements which may well involve pilot projects.

the required credits to the Superannuation Account in addition to the contributions of public service employees and the statutory matching contribution by the Government were regarded as interest, the annual rate of interest in 1968-69 required would be approximately 8 percent.
If the statutory matching contribution by the Government were also regarded as "interest" the annual rate in 1968-69 would be approximately 10J percent.
The assumptions as to levels of final earnings are set out in Appendices 1 and 2 of the Report on Actuarial Examination of the Superannuation Account in the Consolidated Revenue Fund as at December 31, 1962.

What publications have been accepted to date, at second class rates, under Sections 11 (1) b and 11 (1) c of the Post Office Act as amended.


In so far as the Post Office Department is concerned: Up to March 24th, 1,800 publications had been registered as second class mail.
Our records are not now maintained in such a manner that we can determine readily the Section of the Act under which each publication falls. It would, therefore, be necessary to review the records of the 1,800 publications in question.
Consequently the compilation of the information requested would necessitate a review of a substantial number of records, which would be very time consuming and require undue labour and expense.

April 14, 1969
Questions
2.	The initial measurements in Canada were largely restricted to smoke haze or soiling index but during the 1960's other contaminants such as dust-fall, sulphur dioxide and suspended particulates have also been measured routinely in sample cities. At a small number of locations contaminants such as nitrogen oxides, oxidants and carbon monoxide have been measured on a nonroutine basis.
3.	During recent years more than 10,000 pollution readings per month have been received into the central recording section of the Department of National Health and Welfare. These are available for perusal but have not been reduced for convenient publication as yet. Generally, pollution levels in Canadian cities are equivalent to their counterparts in the United States.
