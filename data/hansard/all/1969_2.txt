On Thursday last the hon. member for Peace River (Mr. Baldwin) rose on a question of privilege in relation to the tabling of a report by the Secretary of State (Mr. Pelletier). When tabling the paper, the Secretary of State used the following words:
Mr. Speaker, I should like to table a report concerning the security agents in some of our national museums, which report constitutes a reply to the numerous questions put to me in the house in the last few days.
The report appears to have been presented to the house under Standing Order 41(2). The hon. member for Peace River has expressed the view that the terms of the Standing Order are not sufficiently broad to include the tabling of that particular document. The hon. member has been supported in his contention by the hon. member for Winnipeg North Centre (Mr. Knowles) and the hon. member for Edmonton West (Mr. Lambert).
The hon. member for Winnipeg North Centre has submitted the additional argument that the Secretary of State contravened the rules and practice of the house when he replied to oral questions by tabling the answer under the provisions of Standing Order 41(2). In reply to these objections, the President of the Privy Council (Mr. Macdonald) suggests that Standing Order 41(2) should be given a wide, rather than a restrictive, interpretation. The substance of the minister's argument is summed up in the following words reported at page 4928 of Hansard of Thursday, January 30:
[DOT] (2:10 p.m.)
While Standing Order 41	(1) is really quite
precise as to the documents referred to, Standing Order 41 (2) is in the broadest possible terms. It permits a minister or a parliamentary secretary to lay on the table of the house any report or
other paper dealing with a matter coming within the administrative responsibilities of the government. I believe that the Chair should give the widest interpretation to those words.
Later Thursday afternoon, after the hon. member for Peace River (Mr. Baldwin) had raised his question of privilege, the Minister of Finance (Mr. Benson) tabled a notice of motion to amend the Income Tax Act and the Estate Tax Act pursuant to Standing Order 60, subsection (1).
Then, pursuant to Standing Order 41(2) he attempted to lay on the table a document which the minister described as "explaining the ways and means motion and giving some illustrations of the consequent changes in taxes".
The hon. member for Edmonton West (Mr. Lambert), supported in his views by the hon. member for Winnipeg North Centre (Mr. Knowles), took exception to the procedure. The Chair then suggested that no further proceedings be taken and that the tabling be held in abeyance while the point of order and the previous question of privilege were being considered.

It is fitting to consider first the question of privilege raised by the hon. member for Peace River (Mr. Baldwin) about the tabling of a document by the Secretary of State (Mr. Pelletier) . The hon. member, as well as others who supported his question of privilege, contend that the said document is not one which can be tabled under standing order 41(2). Secondly, they argue that the minister erred when he attempted to reply to questions put by some hon. members by another method than that prescribed by the standing orders. After much thought, I must decide in favour of the hon. members who questioned the procedure used, and especially the hon. member for Winnipeg North Centre (Mr. Knowles) who raised the second objection.
According to the standing orders, a question put during the daily oral question period may be answered either by an oral answer, by an order for return or by a ministerial statement on motions. I must express the opinion that the new standing order 41(2) does not provide for the establishment of a new procedure or answering oral questions.

February 3. 1969
Tabling of Documents
Therefore I must conclude that the question of privilege was justified. I suggest to hon members that as far as answers to questions are concerned, standing order 41(2) should be given that interpretation.

I should like to consider now the procedural point raised in connection with the effort by the Minister of Finance to table the memorandum to which I have already alluded. As hon. members know, Standing Order 41(1) corresponds word for word with the previous rule, Standing Order 40, subsection (1). The Standing Order reads as follows:
Any return, report or other paper required to be laid before the House in accordance with any Act of Parliament or in pursuance of any resolution or Standing Order of this House may be deposited with the Clerk of the House on any sitting day, and such return, report or other paper shall be deemed for all purposes to have been presented to or laid before the House.
That rule, corresponding, as I have said, to the previous Standing Order 40(1) determines the class of documents or papers that must be tabled by a minister pursuant to a statutory provision or to a standing or other order of the house.
The house has now adopted another Standing Order, 41(2), which reads as follows:
A minister of the Crown, or a parliamentary secretary acting on behalf of a minister, may, in his place in the house, state that he proposes to lay upon the table of the house, any report or other paper dealing with a matter coming within the administrative responsibilities of the government and, thereupon, the same shall be deemed for all purposes to have been laid before the house.
The new Standing Order can be interpreted in only one of two ways; either it is intended to provide another method of tabling the papers described in Standing Order 41(1) or it is intended to provide a method to table documents other than those provided in 41(1). In my view, the second interpretation only is logical. Indeed, if Standing Order 41(2) means anything, it must be that it enlarges the class of papers which can be tabled by the government without notice and without leave.
The Chair is bound by the clear words of the rule to the effect that a minister may table any report or other paper dealing with a matter coming within the administrative responsibilities of the government. So long as the report or paper deals with a matter which comes within the administrative responsibility of the government, and that the paper is an official document for which the minister or parliamentary secretary accepts responsibility, it can be tabled pursuant to Standing Order 41(2).
If this interpretation of the rule results in the tabling of a type of paper or document which had not been contemplated by the procedure committee, it is of course open to the members of that committee to review the Standing Order and redraft it in a way which would justify a more restrictive interpretation. For the time being, the Chair would be inclined to accept, for tabling, papers or reports which deal with matters coming within administrative responsibility of the government and which are official papers in the sense that they are proposed to the house by a minister, either directly or through his parliamentary secretary, in the exercise of his ministerial responsibility.


Mr. Speaker, you will recall that last December, when it became necessary to postpone the second constitutional conference, the question of when certain documents would be tabled in the house was raised and I answered that I would take the advice of the authorities of other governments, so that a date acceptable to everybody could be set.
Those consultations have taken place. There is now a general agreement to make those documents known on the following dates:

First, two main working documents of the conference, the report of the continuing committee of officials and a briefing paper on the discussions within that committee, are being released today by the secretariat of the constitutional conference. I should like to table these documents-

-copies in English and in French of those documents.

As to the papers of the Government of Canada, we shall be releasing these on Thursday of this week at 2 p.m. eastern standard time. This is the day generally agreed for the release of material by the participating governments, although certain of the provinces have already made public some of their position papers.
I should also like to table at this time the agenda, in English and French, of the conference beginning next week.

February 3, 1969

2.	What is the composition of the study group on educational broadcasting, what are its terms of reference and, when will it submit its report?
3.	Will this report be tabled in the House?


I am
informed by the Secretary of State and the Postmaster General as follows: 1. No. The policy of the Government, as stated in the House of Commons on May 3, 1946 is still in effect that since broadcasting is the sole responsibility of the Federal Government, broadcasting licences shall not be issued to other governments or corporations owned by other governments.
2.	The members of the Task Force E.T.V. are as follows: Mr. Jules Leger, Under Secretary of State, Chairman; Mr. Gilles Bergeron of the Post Office Department; Mr. D. S. Thorson of the Justice Department; Mr. Michael Pitfield of the Privy Council Office; Mr. Ivo Krupka of the Privy Council Office, Secretary; Mr. George Miedzinski of C.R.T.C. -Head of the Study Group.
The Task Force is to study all aspects of this subject in order to assist the government in fulfilling its undertaking to facilitate the development of adequate broadcasting facilities to meet provincial requirements for the transmission of educational programmes. The Task Force will undertake a variety of specific assignments and is not asked to produce a comprehensive report.

What has been the increase in revenues to the Canadian National Railways from the new less-than-carload-lot rates that were imposed on shippers in the Atlantic Provinces in September, 1967, to this date?
Questions


The management of Canadian National Railways advises as follows: During the period January 1 to October 31, 1968, there have been variations in the comparative total revenues on a month to month basis. However, on a cumulative basis, system revenues from this traffic are less than 1 per cent below the revenues generated in the same period in 1967.


In Canada, in Quebec and in the federal constituency of Portneuf (a) how many telegraph operators were employed by the CNR in 1957 and 1967 (b) how many employees of all categories were employed by the CNR in 1957 and 1967 (c) what was the total amount of salaries paid by this company in 1957 and 1967?


The management of Canadian National Railways advises as follows: As the system is administered by regions which do not conform to the geographical boundaries of the Provinces, also as telegraph operators are grouped with station agents, caretaker agents, levermen and telegraphers, the information is not readily available in the form asked, and to extract the data would entail considerable time and expense.
However, a report entitled "Canadian National Railway and the Province of Quebec", presented to the Sessional Committee on Railways, Air Lines and Shipping on December 12th, 1963, as recorded in the minutes of proceedings and evidence commencing on page 361, states that in 1962 the working force of CN in the Province of Quebec numbered 21,994 and the total wages and salaries of this group exceeded $120,000,000.
The number of employees all categories Canadian Lines and their total compensation for the years in question are as folows:-
No. of employees Total compensation 1957	114,750	$425,030,402.1967	86,200	550,049,038.


On what date in the winter of 1967 did a C.N.R. train, leaving Montreal and going to Ottawa, illegally use a C.P.R. section of tracks, what was the number of that train and how many minutes was the train late in Ottawa because of that incident?

February 3, 1969
Questions


The management of Canadian National Railways advises as follows: The question appears to have reference to an incident which occurred in Ottawa on February 5, 1967 when Canadian National Railway Train No. 133 from Montreal was permitted, by signal, access to Canadian Pacific trackage in preparation for a reverse movement into Ottawa station. Through error, the train crew continued to Navan on the Canadian Pacific trackage. Train No. 133 was 1 hour and 17 minutes late arriving in Ottawa.


1.	What amounts of subsidies were paid to gold mines in Canada during the years 1965, 1966 and 1967?
2.	What amounts of subsidies were paid for products exported from Canada during the years 1965, 1966 and 1967?


I am
informed by the Departments of Energy, Mines and Resources and Industry, Trade and Commerce as follows: 1. Payments to the operators in gold mines in Canada under the Emergency Gold Mining Assistance Act are as follows:
Fiscal years	1965-66	$14,757,573"	"	1966-67	14,959,891"	"	1967-68	15,199,765
2. Payments to the Canadian Wheat Board in support of the minimum prices for the sales of wheat made by the Canadian Wheat Board are:
Fiscal years	1965-66	Nil"	"	1966-67	Nil"	"	1967-68	$2,649,236

1.	Is it Air Canada's policy to oversell airline passenger accommodation on Air Canada flights between (a) Ottawa/Toronto (b) Toronto/Ottawa
(c)	Ottawa/Montreal (d) Montreal/Ottawa (e) Toronto/Montreal (f) Montreal/Toronto?
2.	Does the government intend to reduce the air fare on flights where there is no competition from other airlines?
3.	What is the net revenue earned by Air Canada for passenger service provided between (a) Ottawa/ Montreal (b) Ottawa/Toronto (c) Montreal/Ottawa
(d)	Montreal/Toronto (e) Toronto/Ottawa (f) Toronto/Montreal?


The Management of Air Canada advises as follows: 1. No; the Air Canada reservations system is designed to achieve equalization between demand and capacity well in advance of departure time, and only a breakdown in communications or human error would bring about overbooking at departure time.
3. Air Canada is unable to provide the net revenue earned for passenger service between the city pairs listed, as all flights (with the exception of all-cargo aircraft which does not carry passengers), simultaneously transport passengers, excess baggage, mail, freight and express traffic. It is impossible to segregate the costs of flying aircraft as between the types of traffic carried on board the flights.
Regarding part 2, the government exercises no control over air fares. Regulation of tolls and tariflis is a matter coming under the jurisdiction of the Canadian Transport Commission, pursuant to the provisions of the Aeronautics Act and the National Transportation Act.


1.	With what provinces and municipalities has the Department of Veterans Affairs held discussions about turning over its hospitals?
2.	Have any hospitals operated by the Department been turned over to provincial, municipal or other non-federal control and, if so, which hospitals and on what terms, since the end of the Second World War?
3.	Are any discussions continuing and, if so, involving which hospitals?


1. With the Provinces of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Quebec, Ontario, Manitoba, Alberta, British Columbia, and in addition in recent months discussions have taken place with municipal authorities at London, Ontario,
February 3, 1989

in connection with their interest in our property at Westminster Hospital. In 1949 discussions took place with the City of Toronto concerning the transfer of the departmental Christie Street Hospital to that municipality on the completion of our building program at Sunnybrook Hospital. There were also negotiations with the City of Ste. Hyacinthe, Quebec, in 1955, resulting in their taking over from the Department our T.B. sanatorium at that location, and in 1962 with the Ottawa civic authorities on our abandonment of the Veterans Pavilion at the Civic Hospital upon the opening of the National Defence Medical Centre.
2.	During the immediate post war years there were many transactions between the Department, provincial and municipal authorities and other agencies concerning the disposal of properties that had been used as departmental treatment facilities and which became surplus to our requirements on the building of departmental hospitals or additional wings thereto.
In more recent years the following agreements have taken place:
(1)	The Health and Occupational Centre at Ridgewood near Saint John, New Brunswick was, in 1965, leased for 21 years to the New Brunswick Provincial Workmen's Compensation Board under an agreement by which the Department has a lien on 30 beds for the domiciliary care of entitled veterans. Under the agreement the rental to be paid by the Province to the City of Lancaster is equal to the payments the Federal Government would have made to that municipality in lieu of taxes under the Municipal Grants Act.
(2)	Sunnybrook Hospital, Toronto, was, on October 1, 1966, transferred for one dollar to the University of Toronto. The agreement provided that the Hospital would continue to give priority admission to eligible veterans requiring treatment and accordingly 630 beds were reserved for the active treatment of veterans and 570 beds for chronic and domiciliary care. The staff were guaranteed employment with comparable rates of pay and ancillary benefits. The Federal Government is responsible for the cost of a new wing of 400 beds upon request of the University of Toronto.
(3)	The Veterans Home in Edmonton was, by agreement, in November 1966, transferred to the Province of Alberta for the sum of one dollar. This was replaced by a new chronic and domiciliary care unit of 150 beds adjacent to the University Hospital at a shared
Questions
cost to the Department of $615,000. At the time this was opened in November 1966, the agreement provided that the Wells and Mew-burn pavilions become the property of the Hospital with the Department occupying space for administrative and outpatient purposes.
(4)	Lancaster Hospital, Saint John, New Brunswick, was the subject of an agreement on March 25, 1968 between the Department and the Government of New Brunswick and the General Hospital, Saint John which provided that Lancaster Hospital will be transferred to the Province on July 1, 1970, for the sum of one dollar. The General Hospital has agreed to add a veterans' wing of 300 beds to its own facilities for the priority care of eligible veterans. The Federal Government will make a grant of $4,500,000 to that Hospital. The staff will be assimilated under terms comparable to those arranged at Sunnybrook.
(5)	Ste. Foy Veterans Hospital, Quebec, was, on September 1, 1968, transferred to the Province of Quebec which in turn has deeded it to the University of Laval. The real prop-perty of the hospital was ceded to the Province for one dollar. The Department has priority use of 150 beds for veteran patients of which 110 are for active and chronic care and 40 for domiciliary care. Within six years from the date of transfer the Province will erect a wing of 40 beds, the cost of which will be borne by the Federal Government. The hospital staff have been assimilated by the University of Laval at rates of pay and employee benefits not less favourable than those in effect in the public service at the time of transfer.
3.	Yes, involving: Camp Hill Hospital, Halifax, N.S.; Queen Mary Veterans Hospital, Montreal, P.Q.; Ste. Anne's Hospital, Ste. Anne de Bellevue, P.Q.; Westminster Hospital, London, Ontario.; Deer Lodge Hospital, Winnipeg, Manitoba.; Colonel Belcher Hospital, Calgary, Alberta.; Shaughnessy Hospital, Vancouver, B.C.; Veterans Hospital, Victoria, B.C.; George Derby Veterans Home, Burnaby, B.C.


1.	Does the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation have a specific policy regarding the use and distribution of time it allots to (a) apolitical movements (b) political movements (c) others for public information over its networks, both (i) radio, and (ii) television?

February 3, 1969
Questions
2.	If so, when was the policy adopted and on what principle (s) is it based?
3.	If not, will such a policy be adopted and when?
4.	If there is no intention of adopting such a policy, for what reason?


I am informed by the C.B.C. as follows: 1. Yes. Free time is allocated to bona fide political parties for the expression of opinion. There is no allocation of free time to groups other than bona fide political parties but the Corporation applies to all controversial issues the principles enunciated in reply to Part 2.
2.	The policy of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation governing political and controversial broadcasting was adopted in the early years of public broadcasting and is based on the following principles: (i) The air belongs to the people who are entitled to hear the principal points of view on all questions of importance; (ii) The air must not fall under the control of any individuals or groups influential by reason of their wealth or special position; (iii) The right to answer is inherent in the doctrine of free speech; (iv) The full interchange of opinion is one of the principal safeguards of free institutions.
The C.B.C. does not sell time to individuals or commercial concerns for broadcasts of opinions or propaganda. It furthers the foregoing principles by the provision of free time to competent speakers to present, without let or hindrance, varying points of view on questions of the day. The C.B.C. considers that the best safeguard of freedom of discussion is a policy which permits fair opportunity for the expression of varied points of view on issues of public interest and concern.
C.B.C. policy with regard to party political broadcasting is based on the fact that for the proper functioning of representative and democratic government, it is essential that the public should be fully informed of the issues at stake in any provincial or federal election, and of the position and policies of the various parties on these issues. To carry out this policy, the C.B.C. follows a general plan for party political broadcasting which includes the provision of network time free of charge to recognized political parties during general elections. This gives all qualifying parties the opportunity of speaking to a wide public, irrespective of their capacity to buy time. In the periods between elections, an amount of free, network time is

made available to recognized party leaders or their representatives.
The allocation of free time broadcasts between elections traditionally has been established at a meeting between the C.B.C. and qualifying parties held at the beginning of each new Parliament.
Free time broadcast periods during election campaigns are also allocated in immediate consultation with the parties.

1.	According to the latest available statistics, what is the total number of unemployed persons in Canada?
2.	What was the comparable figure for the same month in 1967?
3.	Has the government any plans for alleviating winter unemployment?
4.	If so, what types of programs are projected?


I am
informed by the Dominion Bureau of Statistics, the Departments of Manpower and Immigration and Finance as follows: 1. The total number of unemployed persons in Canada was estimated to be 338,000 in the week ended November 16, 1968.
2.	The comparable figure for the same month in 1967 was 289,000. The number of employed persons rose from 7,409,000 to
7,677,000	over the same period of time.
3 and 4. The Department of Manpower and Immigration gives consideration at all times to the improvement of manpower programs in order to combat not only winter unemployment but unemployment in general. In the current fiscal year, the federal government will spend $197 million to provide training and retraining for adult workers. As compared with the previous fiscal year, this is an increase of $47 million. The training program is planned, in co-operation with the provinces, so that, wherever possible, adult workers are placed in training when they are unemployed. There is also a program which will this fiscal year provide various kinds of mobility grants to approximately 30,000 workers involving an expenditure of $4 million. The counselling and placement services of Canada Manpower Centres across the country have been greatly extended and improved.
February 3, 1969

Although the Department of Finance does not administer any programs having the direct effect of creating winter employment, its whole fiscal policy is aimed at balancing the goals of full employment, price stability and economic growth.


How many veterans have been provided for under the domiciliary care provisions of the Veterans Charter each year and in each veterans' hospital since 1960?
Questions


The domiciliary care provisions of the Veterans Charter are contained in section 29 of the Veterans Treatment Regulations made under authority of the Department of Veterans Affairs Act. The following table shows the number of patients in hospital under this section of the Regulations as of March 31 of each year from 1960 to 1968. These include both chronic care and domiciliary (bed and board) types of cases but departmental statistics do not provide a breakdown of the number of patients in each category.

Is the Road and Motor Vehicle Traffic Safety Office giving consideration to testing "artificial gravel" a substance used in improving highway safety by grading dangerous curves?


As indicated in my announcement of October 17, 1967, outlining the responsibility of the Department of Transport in the field of motor vehicle and highway safety, the new office will have responsibility for program co-ordination and the establishment of safety standards. Therefore, the Road and Motor Vehicle Traffic Safety Office will not itself undertake tests on "artificial gravel" or similar road building materials.
The Road and Motor Vehicle Traffic Safety Office is closely following the progress of tests currently being made by a number of agencies, including some provincial government departments and particularly those relating to skid resistance of pavement surfaces to traffic accidents. The relationships between aggregate texture, polishing and skid resistance have not as yet been completely evaluated.


Is consideration being given to requiring car manufacturers to inform car owners at the point of sale of the car's performance in such areas as (a) vehicle stopping distance (b) driver field of view (c) acceleration and passing ability (d) overall steering ratio (e) flammability of materials in car interiors?


The Department of Transport is not at present considering the need for providing vehicle performance capability information to automobile purchasers. The new Office on Road and Motor Vehicle Traffic Safety in the Department is, however, concerned with safety standards for new vehicles at the point of manufacture.
Officials of my Department are closely following the discussions in the United States on proposals which would require providing such information to automobile purchasers at the point of sale. There is some question regarding the real ultimate value of the knowledge that would be made available, quite apart from the difficulty of standardizing the manner in which it could be most usefully presented.
February 3, 1983


Is consideration being given to investigating alleged high cost and low quality of the car repair industry?


The Department of Transport does not have authority to undertake the type of investigation implied in the question.
The car repair industry is highly localized, hence any action that might initially be taken would be on the municipal or provincial government level.

1. 500,000 in English and 10,000 in French.
2.	Cost of printing was approximately 9 cents per copy in English and 10 cents per copy in French. Distribution cost was approximately 5 cents per copy.
3.	Yes. The examples shown on pages 9 and 10 of the booklet were revised and the instructions on pages 39, 40 and 41 were rewritten.
4.	Changes in the instructions and examples were necessary in order to provide employers with up-to-date information. This could have been accomplished either by issuing a circular or by issuing a revised contribution table.

Has the federal government considered the advisability of acquiring the island group of St. Pierre and Miquelon which are located within the territorial waters of Canada?


1. The answer to the question is in the negative. I might point out that the islands of St. Pierre and Miquelon are not located within the territorial waters of Canada. They were ceded to France by Great Britain under the Treaty of Versailles of September 3, 1783, and comprise part of the Overseas Territories of France.

The Minister of Consumer and Corporate Affairs, through his departmental officers, has been in communication with the Reader's Digest Company concerning their Lucky Number Draw Promotion mailings.
The Minister has not made representations to the Reader's Digest Company protesting the company's policy of informing members of the public without solicitation that they have become trial members of the plan and billing them accordingly, because the Company has stated that they never, under any circumstances, enter a trial membership, or send merchandise without having first received a positive response to advertising material.

During the fiscal years ending March 31, 1965, 1966, 1967 and 1968, what amounts were paid by the government in travelling expenses for each federal Cabinet Minister?
Return tabled.


Mr. Speaker, I have a question for the Prime Minister. In view of the request made by several of the provincial premiers in western Canada that economic matters should be given priority over the other important matters to be discussed at the federal-provincial conference next week, is it the intention of the government to comply with this request?


Mr. Speaker, we have already complied with this request. If the hon. gentleman would look at the agenda that we have tabled, he would see that the matter of distribution of powers has a high place on the agenda and that within distribution of powers we specify fiscal matters and the spending power of the federal government.
I think it is important for the public to understand that the constitutional aspects of the spending power are really the ones that should be discussed. When the provinces are worried about the federal government's interfering-as they say-in certain provincial priorities, what they are really doing is calling into question the spending power as exercised for 100 years by the federal government. We are prepared to reopen discussion on this if and when the provinces want, except that we do believe that it is essentially a constitutional matter. We also believe that the provincial demands for discussing this matter can fit very easily within the agenda, which has been modified since November, to answer this demand by certain provinces.
Inquiries of the Ministry


Mr. Speaker, before I ask a supplementary question I would point out to the Prime Minister that naturally it was impossible for me to know what priority would be given-


Oh, oh.


-to economic matters because the program has just been-


Order, please. The hon. member should ask his question.


I should like to ask the Prime Minister a supplementary question. Is it the intention of the government to comply with the request of provincial premiers that the
