Wednesday, February 19, 1969
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a question of privilege which I think should be brought to the attention of Your Honour and of the house, and in respect of which I have given notice pursuant to the appropriate standing order. This matter of privilege is one that I think affects to a considerable extent the members of this house; certainly it affects the hon. members on the government side directly, and I suppose all members indirectly.
I come directly to the point. My question of privilege arises from a statement that is made in what appears to be a form letter sent out by the hon. member for York East (Mr. Otto) to what would appear to be the electors of his constituency. With much of what he says in his letter or circular I agree, and I want to make it plain that I am not making any charges or suggestion, or saying anything derogatory about the hon. member. The particular part of the letter that needs to be brought to the attention of the house reads as follows:
The new rules are now in effect, in the House of Commons, and since you will recall that I fought for these changes for six years, I am pleased to report that the business of the House of Commons will at long last progress with some efficiency.


Hear, hear.


I am glad the hon. members are seizing the only opportunity that they will have to applaud the contents of this letter. It continues:
There have been some disappointments, mostly in the composition and power of the committees, because although the committees have been given a great deal of work to do, the government members of the committee have been instructed to make no changes to the bills, coming before the committee-


Shame.
[DOT] (2:10 p.m.)


I continue:
-and to vote exactly as they are told by the government. However, since I have dealt with this at some length in a speech which was well covered by the press, I shall not go further into this subject, at this time.


Shame.


If this letter is widely circulated in Toronto hon. members on the government side of the house may be subjected to criticism or abuse which this letter is bound to generate.
To show that there is some foundation to my question of privilege may I quote from citation 210 of Beauchesne's Parliamentary Rules and Forms, third edition:
The privilege of freedom of speech enjoyed by members of parliament is in truth the privilege of their constituents. It is secured to members not for their personal benefit, but to enable them to discharge the functions of their office-
In some instances that rule has been exercised to protect hon. members from prosecution. To some extent the encroachments of the party system in the House of Commons have diminished this rule. Sometimes, on questions of principle, we vote by party. However, we were led to believe after June 25 that all this was to be changed and that the millenium had arrived, the golden age. While debating certain proposals in the Procedure Committee we were told that in the new committee system hon. members supporting the government, hon. members of Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition and hon. members of all other parties could park their partisanship outside the committee room and, in the "clubby" spirit of the new committees, work with one another for the benefit of the people of Canada. If the contents of the letter I have referred to are correct, and I hope the Prime Minister will take the opportunity to contradict what the letter says, the government has destroyed the edifice of the committee system on which our new rules are predicated. Despite what some of the more experienced members of my party said, I was naive enough to believe that partisanship would have no place in our committee structure. It appears I was mistaken.
5696	COMMONS
Alleged Issue of Document on New Rules
It might be well to put on record again comments made by the Prime Minister a few short years ago. They appeared in a magazine, and were quoted at page 2801 of Hansard for November 15, 1968. In particular the Prime Minister, as reported on that page of Hansard, wrote these words as they are set out in the article in question:
I am only concerned with the anti-democratic reflexes of spineless Liberal herd.
We thought that those words applied to a situation of the past. I urge the right hon. gentleman to rise and say publicly that hon. members of his party have every freedom to go into a committee room under the committee system which now prevails and vote as they see fit; and that in the discussion of those questions which are important and of benefit to the people of Canada they have full freedom of expression which members of parliament must have to discharge their responsibilities.


Order, please. I doubt that it is the intention of hon. members to have protracted discussion on the point of privilege raised by the hon. member for Peace River. The Chair has to decide whether there is a prima facie case of privilege. I think that the Chair can immediately, without further debate, make a ruling on that point. I am sure if one hon. member is allowed to participate further in the debate it may go on for a while. Wednesday is a short day, and perhaps we ought to go on to the business on today's order paper.
I suggest that if any group of hon. members or any one hon. member is concerned about the question of privilege, it would be hon. members of the government or the hon. member for York East (Mr. Otto). The matter has

not been raised as a question of privilege by the hon. member for York East, and I doubt very much if, in the circumstances, the hon. member for Peace River has raised a legitimate question of privilege. In any event, the question has not been followed by a motion. There being no motion before the house I suggest that the Chair has no alternative except to declare that there shall be no discussion.


The Prime Minister is saved.

Questions


(a) Mr. Speaker, pursuant to Section 32(1) of the Public Service Superannuation Act, interest is credited to the superannuation accounts on the last day of each quarter in the fiscal year calculated at the rate of 1 per cent of the balance to the credit of the account on the last day of the preceding quarter, (b) In lieu of crediting interest at a higher rate than that described in paragraph (a), the government makes special credits to the superannuation account, pursuant to Section 32(2) and (3). It is estimated that during the fiscal year 1968-69, these special credits will be equivalent to interest at a rate of 3| per cent to 4 per cent per annum in addition to the rate mentioned in paragraph (a). This is in response to the first part of the question.
In response to the second part of the question, the average yields at the weekly tender of treasury bills over the past six months ranges from a low of 5.43 per cent on August 28, 1968 to a high of 6.65 per cent on January 9, 1969.
The amount, coupon rate, and yield at time of issue of the government's borrowings in the bond market over the past six months are set forth in a table and I would ask the consent of the house that this table be printed in Hansard.


Does the hon. member have leave?


Agreed.

1.	Is the government taking steps to ensure that Montreal Harbour operates all year round and, if so, what steps and, if not, for what reason is action not being taken?
2.	Does the government intend to increase the use of containers in Montreal Harbour and, if not, for what reason?
3.	Does the government intend to impose a toll on the St. Lawrence River and, if so, for what reason?


1.	It is not possible for the government to ensure that Montreal Harbour operates all year round because the river can be blocked by ice jams which are the result of weather and other natural causes and which cannot be entirely prevented with the technology now available.
To the extent that it is possible, it has long been the practice to maintain an open channel for the evacuation of ice in order to reduce the incidence of floods and measures and devices for this purpose are constantly being studied and improved. Ships wishing to go to Montreal may use this channel when it is open and are assisted to the extent that government resources will allow.
2.	Facilities for the handling of container traffic are available at Montreal Harbour. An
February 19, 1969

increase in the use of containers is a matter for decision by shipping companies.
3.	There are no plans at present for the imposition of tolls on shipping in the St. Lawrence River.

This licence will allow entry to any of the above parks only and is good for any number of trips during a fiscal year. A 25 cent single trip licence is also available for parks in this category.
A park motor licence is not required for Wood Buffalo or Georgian Bay Islands
[Mr. Forest.l
National Parks nor is one required for parks in the Atlantic Provinces.
Note: In addition to the passenger car fees there are fees for various other vehicles and trailers such as buses and different sizes and types of trucks. These are listed in the Schedule of the National Parks Highway Traffic Regulations but are too numerous to list in the answer.
3.	For the fiscal year ending March 31, 1968 the totals were: Mount Revelstoke-Glacier, $306,244; Yoho, $9,133; Kootenay, $77,582; Banff, $622,183; Jasper, $105,877; Waterton Lakes, $82,190; Elk Island, $20,829; Prince Albert, $15,004; Riding Mountain, $47,019; Point Pelee, $39,559; St. Lawrence Islands, $5,568.
4.	I have examined the press accounts following the news conference and noted that in answer to a question from the press Mr. Nicol indicated accurately that park entrance fees and other fees were currently under review. When the review is completed and recommendations made the decision as to whether there shall be an increase and if so, its extent, will be made and announced by me.


1.	Does the Department of Transport intend to install blind landing equipment in government aircraft?
2.	Is the government considering the possibility of requiring commercial airlines operating in Canada to install blind landing equipment?
3.	Does the government have automatic landing equipment installed in any of its aircraft and, if not, will it consider the advisability of installing such equipment in government aircraft and will it also require that this kind of equipment be installed in commercial aircraft?


I am informed by the Departments of National Defence and Transport as follows: 1. No, there are no plans for such an installation.
2.	No.
3.	The government does not have automatic landing equipment in any of its aircraft and no consideration is being given at this time to the advisability of installing such equipment. The provision of automatic landing equipment in commercial aircraft is not expected to be made mandatory.

1.	Are enterprises in Banff, Alberta, departmental and otherwise, pouring raw sewage into the streams and Bow River?
2.	Has the CPR constructed a sewage disposal plant in their hotels at Banff and Lake Louise, and is raw sewage being poured into the rivers and streams in the Park by these hotels?


Mr. Speaker, the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development reports as follows: 1. Sewage from the Banff townsite sewer system is presently discharged untreated into the Bow River. The department plans a sewage treatment plant for the town of Banff in the near future.
2.	The C.P.R. has constructed a sewage disposal plant at Chateau Lake Louise. Sewage from the Banff Springs Hotel enters the Banff townsite sewage system and is discharged untreated.


Has the International Control Commission, on which Canada is represented, been requested at any time in the past six months to investigate allegations of North Vietnamese massive infiltration into Laotian Territory and, if so, with what results?


Within the last six months, the Royal Laotian Government has, on three occasions, complained to the International Control Commission about the illegal presence and activities of North Vietnamese forces in Laos as evidenced by attacks on the government post at Thateng in the southern panhandle adjoining South Vietnam (Royal Laotian Government notes dated November 29, 1968, December 14, 1968 and January 9, 1969). Despite the efforts of the Canadian Delegation to have formal investigations made of these complaints, only the first two were subjected to first-hand inquiry by Commission representatives but only in a preliminary way during an "observation visit" on January 2-3 of this year. As regards the third complaint, our Commission partners-India and Poland-voted against a Canadian proposal for an investigation and no further action on the complaint has been taken.
Questions
Final judgments have not yet been rendered by the Commission on the factual conclusions which can be drawn from the evidence available on these incidents. The Canadian Delegation has been attempting to obtain agreement on a Commission report not only of its visit to Thateng but of visits to other towns in the same area which the Commission made in February and April 1968 in response to similar complaints by the Royal Laotian Government.
Direct evidence regarding the exact extent of North Vietnamese infiltration into Laos is difficult for the Commission to establish because it is not permitted entry into the communist-controlled areas of Laos. Nevertheless, evidence of North Vietnamese military activity in Laos-in contravention of the terms of the 1962 Geneva settlement relating to that country-has been clearly established by the Commission in areas controlled by the Royal Laotian Government and has been made public and reported to the House on earlier occasions.


Is the government considering closing the Customs and Excise office at Meteghan River, Nova Scotia and, if so, on what date?


The Customs operations at the Outport of Meteghan River are currently being reviewed to determine whether services provided are consistent with existing needs and are fully justified in relation to administrative and operational costs. The review has not been concluded and I am therefore not in a position at this time to say whether or not the Customs office will be maintained at that location.


Does the federal government provide police and/or security service for Embassies and Consulates of foreign countries and, if so, what was the cost of the service provided during each of the years 1960-68 inclusive?


In so far as the Department of External Affairs is concerned, yes. The cost for each of the years 1960-68 was: 19601966 inclusive, Nil; 1967, $40,736.48; 1968, $31,059.50.

Shall the remaining questions stand?1


Mr. Speaker, on December 10 I filed question No. 1,008 relating to the establishment by the Prime Minister (Mr. Trudeau) of regional desks, the appointment of personnel, and volunteer advisers. It is now well over two months since the question was put on the order paper. The information must surely be easily available to the staff of the Prime Minister's office or of the Privy Council office, particularly in view of the Prime Minister's increased staff, and I am wondering why I could not have an answer by now.


If I may give a word of explanation, Mr. Speaker, the question has not been answered because the regional desk system is not completed yet. We are reorganizing it; we are even adding to it, and I think it might be better if I could answer the hon. member once and for all when the thing is established, rather than answer him now and have him put supplementary questions later. I can assure the hon. member that it will not be very many more weeks until the system is completed and fully in operation.


Shall the remaining questions stand?


Agreed.


Mr. Speaker, would you kindly call notices of motions Nos. 65, 68 and 69?
I ask, Mr. Speaker, that the remaining notices of motions be allowed to stand.


Motion No. 65-Mr. Marshall:
That an humble Address be presented to His Excellency praying that he will cause to be laid before this House a copy of all correspondence between the Government of Canada particularly
February 19, 1969
as represented by the Department of Public Works, the Atlantic Development Board and the Area Development Agency, and the Government of the Province of Newfoundland with respect to the development of a chip mill at Happy Valley, Labrador, a liner board mill at Stephenville, Newfoundland, and supporting facilities in these two areas.
Mr. Speaker, the information requested by the hon. member for Humber-St. George's-St. Barbe (Mr. Marshall) is of a confidential nature given to the government of Canada in the course of government investigation for particular purposes, disclosure of which could be detrimental to the competitive position of the firms.
I have spoken to the hon. member and explained this matter to him, I understand that he will consent to the removal of this notice of motion from the order paper.


I agree, Mr. Speaker.
Order discharged and motion withdrawn.


Motion No. 68-Mr. Laiulippe:
That an humble Address be presented to His Excellency praying that he will cause to be laid before this House a copy of all correspondence exchanged between the Government of Canada, particularly as represented by the Department of Public Works, the Atlantic Development Board and the Regional Development Corporation, and the Government of the Province of Quebec on the subject of the wharves and post offices which are supposed to be built in the federal constituency of Compton.
Mr. Speaker, I have been informed that no correspondence has been exchanged on the subject mentioned by the hon. member for Compton in his notice of motion and I wonder, in the circumstances, whether he would accept to withdraw his motion.


I agree.


Is the motion withdrawn?
Motion withdrawn.


Shall the remaining notices of motion stand?


Agreed.
Inquiries of the Ministry


Mr. Speaker, I would like to direct a question to the Minister of Finance. It arises from the statement made yesterday by the Chairman of Air Canada to the effect that Air Canada will need some $300 million more than it can generate from its own revenues to cover the obligations it envisages in the next five years. Will the minister say whether the government is now considering any request from this Crown corporation to issue common shares to the public?


Not at this point, Mr. Speaker.


As a supplementary question, Mr. Speaker, in view of the importance of this service to the Canadian public and the importance of this corporation being able to make its plans well in advance, can the minister indicate the present status of the study regarding possible mergers with this corporation, and will he indicate when a decision will be forthcoming on this matter, as well as on the question as to how the corporation is to meet its various needs?


I am not aware of any such studies as my hon. friend mentioned. Perhaps I could refer that part of the question to the Minister of Transport.
The matter of financing Air Canada in the future, with regard to borrowing, has not been decided at this point. Discussions however, are going on between the government and the president of Air Canada.


Mr. Speaker, I have a supplementary question which perhaps I should direct to the Minister of Transport or to the Minister without Portfolio. May we be assured that before any of these loans are negotiated the government will make a statement to parliament concerning its intentions about Air Canada, its corporate structure and any negotiations it might be entering into with Canadian Pacific Air Lines.


I would be hesitant to give that assurance

February 19, 1969
Inquiries of the Ministry because I do not think the two things are necessarily related. One is strictly a financial mechanism which really comes under the jurisdiction of my colleague the Minister of Finance. It might easily be that he would say that was the best method of financing at some stage. I have already given the assurance that every opportunity for debate will be given before any decision is made public in respect of the latter part of the question.


Meantime are we to be led along the garden path?


Mr. Speaker, may I ask the Minister of Finance whether, in view of the length of time involved in making adequate plans to provide an adequate air service in the future, he would press for a clarification concerning the future of Air Canada, so that the country will be assured of a reasonable air service.


I believe adequate future planning is being carried out by Air Canada. The matter of financing future aircraft acquisitions, and so on, in respect of Air Canada is a matter for discussion between the officials of Air Canada and the Department of Finance. The best method of financing and the acquisition of aircraft will be determined after looking at the pros and cons of various alternatives.


Mr. Speaker, could the Prime Minister give the house an assurance that Air Canada, that great national utility, if I might call it such, will not be sacrificed in order to confirm or conform with the expressed wishes of the Minister without Portfolio from Manitoba who during the election campaign, stated that Canada should dispose of it?


The fion. member for York South.


Mr. Speaker, I have asked a question. I cannot understand why the Prime Minister, who is usually very fast in trying to answer questions, would not take advantage of the opportunity to assure the people of Canada that this is not going to be sacrificed.


The hon. member for York South.


Mr. Speaker, I should like to ask a question of the Minister of Consumer and Corporate Affairs arising out of the report of a tfiree year study in Alberta complaining about the monopolistic control of service stations by large oil companies. Has the report been drawn to the attention of the minister, and will he consult with the provincial attorneys-general in respect of appropriate action under the Combines Investigation Act or the Corporations Act dealing with this field.


At the present time all I have is reports about the report. We have sent a wire to Alberta asking for a copy of the report, and when it is received it will receive our very close attention and study.


Mr. Speaker, I have a question for the Minister of National Defence.
Is it true that his department has refused to cede to the Department of Transport the land that it owns in Farnham, for the construction of the future international airport in that locality?


Order. I do not think that the question as put is in order. The hon. member is asking the minister to confirm or deny a news item and, for that reason, the question cannot be allowed.


Mr. Speaker, I should like to address this question to the Minister of National Health and Welfare. As the cost of living has increased by 8J per cent during the two years since old age pensions were tied to the cost of living, and since pensions have been raised by only 4 per cent during the same period is the government reconsidering the adequacy of the correction formula with a view to making sure that the old age pension increases at
February 19, 1969

exactly the same rate as the increase in the cost of living.


Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is aware of the many improvements and progressive changes we have made to the old age pension scheme in the last few years. He is also aware that at the present time we have under review this particular scheme and all other programs in the old age security field.


Mr. Speaker, as the minister's answer confirms what I have suggested, I should like to ask the Prime Minister whether this short-changing in respect of old age pensioners is a cornerstone of the just society?


Order, please.


Mr. Speaker, I should like to ask the Secretary of State for External Affairs whether the government has extended an invitation to the secretariat of the Commonwealth association to hold the next Commonwealth meetings in Canada?


No, Mr. Speaker.


Is it the intention of the government to extend an invitation?


Mr. Speaker, it is not necessary to make a decision on that question at the present time.


Mr. Speaker, I should like to ask the Minister of Finance whether any consultations are taking place or consideration is being given to lessening the quotas of textiles allowed into Canada, particularly men's shirts from low wage countries? I ask this question because of the announcement today by Cluett Peabody and Company of Canada Limited that they are closing their plant at Stratford, which manufactures men's shirts and which will throw some 160 people out of work.


Mr. Speaker, I am aware of this development which my hon. friend mentioned, and the
Inquiries of the Ministry difficulties that certain shirt manufacturing companies have recently had to face. Indeed it was because of the increase in low priced imports of woven shirts during 1967 and 1968 that last year we negotiated export restraint arrangements with several additional low wage countries in order to prevent further damage to Canadian shirt manufacturers. It seems reasonably certain that with the additional agreements now in effect imports of low priced shirts will decline in 1969 to levels which should provide some relief to Canadian manufacturers.


When you get through some of us will have no shirts.


Mr. Speaker, in respect of these agreements was Japan also included?


Yes, Mr. Speaker, we negotiated quotas with Japan. We also negotiated quotas with other countries which are considered low wage countries.


My question is directed to the Minister of Finance, Mr. Speaker. It arises out of the question asked by the hon. member for Perth concerning the closure of a Canadian shirt factory. Does the minister now realize that as a result of his policies Canadians are rapidly losing their shirts?


Mr. Speaker, I should like to ask the Minister of Transport in his capacity or responsibility for housing whether he is considering a recommendation to the Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation that the fees charged by lawyers appointed by the corporation to handle mortgages on houses be reduced along the lines recommended by the task force.


I believe this question was asked previously. If the hon. member thinks there is urgency in asking it a second time it might be placed on the order paper or discussed at the time of adjournment.


Mr. Speaker, I should like to ask the Minister of

February 19, 1969
Inquiries of the Ministry National Health and Welfare whether he is meeting with a group of hockey executives tomorrow with a view to setting up a structure for a more effective national hockey team and, if so, what part if any will the recommendations of the task force on sports play in this issue?


Order, please. I have some doubt as to whether the question is one of urgency. If hon. members are agreed that the question and an answer should be allowed I have no objection.


Let him answer.


The hon. member for Prince Edward-Hastings having suggested the question is urgent, it shall be allowed.


Mr. Speaker, in answer to the hon. member, I am meeting tomorrow with the hockey executives and other people interested in the hockey situation in Canada, with the end in view of improving the Canadian position in international hockey. We will be considering the matter of bringing in those people to see whether the situation can be improved. As to what effect the task force recommendations will have on this development, we will have to wait until that force completes its findings and makes a report. It is bound to have some effect. Whether one of the courses of action will be a reference to a parliamentary committee to study the whole question, is something I do not know at this time.


Mr. Speaker, can the minister say whether the government intends to have the whole relationship between professional and amateur hockey examined by a parliamentary committee?


As I have indicated, Mr. Speaker, this is a course of action to which the government will have to give consideration.


Mr. Speaker, my question relates to an oral answer today in respect of a question appearing on the order paper. Pollution is a very important national problem facing Canada. The parliamentary secretary admitted that raw sewage from Banff township, which over

1.500.000	people visit each summer, is being poured into the river. Will the government now build the necessary facilities to make certain that the Bow River will be kept pure, in view of the fact that this affects some
750.000	people?
Perhaps in the absence of the minister I might redirect a question to the parliamentary secretary. In the event he has no answer I should like to ask the Prime Minister this question, because I know he has studied pollution and considers it one of the most important national problems facing Canada.


On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, it seems to me that from a government which professes to be in favour of increased dialogue we are getting an awful lot of nonanswers and silence.


Mr. Speaker, in the absence of both ministers involved with Indian Affairs and northern development I should like to ask the Prime Minister whether he can enunciate clearly at an early date what the responsibilities and duties are of the hon. member for Port Arthur (Mr. Andras) in respect of his association with the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, because there is a great deal of doubt about this in the minds of the native Indian people. They should like to know what his functions are.


Mr. Speaker, I wish to direct my question to the Minister of Finance.
Since it has been reported this morning that Canada has just agreed to a $2 million loan to Ceylon for 40 years without interest, could the Minister of Finance give the house the assurance that a similar loan could be granted to the city of Montreal in order to save Man and His World?


Order. The hon. member for Charlevoix.


Ten o'clock, Mr. Speaker.
February 19, 1969


Mr. Speaker, I wish to ask a question to the Prime Minister. In its brief to the government the Confederation of National Trade Unions has pointed out that unemployment in the country has reached alarming proportions, especially in Quebec, and urged the government to devise economic incentives to correct the situation. Could the Prime Minister tell the house whether or not it is his intention to follow up the unions' proposal?


The hon. member for
Timiskaming.


Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.
I maintain that this matter is of an urgent and extremely important nature, since the rate of unemployment in Quebec is currently 8.2 per cent.


Order. The hon. member for Timiskaming.


Mr. Speaker, I should like to ask the Prime Minister, through you, whether he is in a position to advise the house when arrangements will be completed as to the turning over to the House of Commons of control of the East Block, necessitated by the need for office space made necessary by changes in translation and other services?


Mr. Speaker, in view of the continuing starvation in Biafra, will the Canadian government exert diplomatic and political pressure on the Nigerian government to stop the terror bombing that has recently had the effect of reducing drastically full capacity relief flights at the Ulhi airstrip?


Mr. Speaker, I think it would be more useful to put pressure on
Inquiries of the Ministry Colonel Ojukwu to agree to daylight flights; then the possibility of bombing would be greatly reduced.


Mr. Speaker, my question
