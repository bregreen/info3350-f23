Under Department of Supply and Services News Release C-495, what tenders were submitted for Special Spectacle Frames GF-10001-1-D350?


The AOCO Ltd. of Belleville, Ont. and the Defence Research Board have been developing these Combat
Spectacle Frames, for wear under gas masks, since 1963. As a consequence the AOCO company was the only one invited to quote on the requirement. AOCO Limited submitted a cost breakdown to support its tendered price of $18,400 for 2,200 pr. of spectacle frames and it was reviewed by the DSS and considered reasonable and acceptable based on examination of the Company's operating costs and production forecasts.


What terms of reference are laid down by the government to co-ordinate information and assistance to the unemployed between Manpower counsellors and UIC skilled, trained interviewers?


When unemployed workers make application for unemployment insurance benefits, they are referred to a Canada Manpower Centre if they require the services provided by the Centre and have not contacted it prior to applying for benefit. Subsequently, if the Unemployment Insurance Commission interviewers determine that claimants who have not recently contacted a Centre are in need of the services provided by the Centres, appointments are made for the claimants to be interviewed by Manpower Counsellors. Also, Canada Manpower Centres provide Unemployment Insurance Commission interviewers with current labour market information. Canada Manpower Centres and Unemployment Insurance Commission offices provide the public with pamphlets, application forms and other material dealing with the programs and services of the other organization. A committee of officials of the Unemployment Insurance Commission and the Department of Manpower and Immigration has recently been established to investigate further means of co-ordination between the two organizations to provide greater assistance to the unemployed.

In a number of cases the amounts of pensions paid by Canadian National Railways do not represent the total pensions payable to employees for railway service. Pensions payable by the CNR to international employees (service in both Canada and the United States) relate to their service in Canada only. Such employees also receive annuities payable under the U.S. Railroad Retirement Act or the Social Security Act for service performed in the United States. For example, in the group receiving pensions of under $25
April 17, 1972

from the CNR, there are 31 former international employees who also receive U.S. Railroad Retirement or Social Security annuities in respect of CNR service rendered in the United States. The balance of this group consists of employees who elected early retirement (before age 65) with reduced basic ($25) pensions, and employees who had very short service and small contributions.

Does the Canadian government intend to allow or does it allow British soldiers to train in Canada for later fighting in Ireland and, if so, in what manner does the government consider it possible to remain neutral in the conflict between the United Kingdom and Ireland?


Members of the British Armed Forces have trained in Canada on a relatively small scale for the past ten years. In August 1971, an Agreement was signed between the Governments of Canada and of the United Kingdom covering this existing training and providing for increased use of Canadian military training facilities by British soldiers. Under the terms of the Agreement, Brit-
April 17, 1972

ish training in Canada will involve a range of activities from flying instruction to training in the use of tank guns, artillery and anti-tank weapons. This training is carried out by the British forces within the context of their NATO obligations, and is not designed to enhance their capabilities in support of the civilian authority in Northern Ireland. The Canadian Government has, of course, no control over the subsequent assignment of these or any other British forces outside Canada. This program of training should be viewed in the context of Canadian and British membership in NATO as a part of a long-standing tradition of bilateral co-operation in the defence field.

No formal proposal has been made to the Department of Transport that a private aerodrome be built near Louisburg. Interest in such a scheme has been expressed to the Department of Transport by the Louisburg District Planning and Development Commission and by the Canadian Owners and Pilots Association. Regional officials of the Transport Department are providing technical assistance in this matter. If or when a formal proposal is received, the Transport Department will inspect the site and advise the applicant if all licensing criteria and zoning requirements would be able to be met.

1.	With respect to the reply to Question No. 132 at page 1277 of Hansard dated November 18, 1970, is the government in a position to indicate the results of the program to determine whether reduced landing fees at international airports would attract transoceanic flights for technical stop purposes?
2.	Did the results of this program indicate the possibility of including the Halifax International Airport on a trial basis or a permanent basis?


1. The program of reduced landing fees for technical stop purposes to attract trans-oceanic flights to Canada achieved its objectives at Gander International Airport only.
2. The results of the program indicate little potential for extending the program at this time to Halifax International Airport or any other international airport.


1.	How many full-time employees were on the payroll of the Department of Manpower and Immigration (excluding those engaged in immigration activities), as of April 1, 1966 and April 1, 1971, separately for Ottawa headquarters and elsewhere?
2.	How many full-time employees were on the payroll of the National Employment Service as of April 1, 1964, separately for Ottawa headquarters and elsewhere?


1. April 1, 1966-Ottawa Headquarters, 563; Field Staff, 5,088; April 1, 1971- Ottawa Headquarters, 953; Field Staff 5,947. It should be pointed out that comparisons between these two time periods may be misleading. Organizational changes took place between 1966 and 1971 which resulted in many positions, related to immigration activities, being transferred elsewhere in the Department. For example, in 1968 130 positions comprising the Immigration registry and stenographic pool were transferred to Departmental Administration.
2. It is not possible for this Department from records available to answer this part of the question. In 1964, the staff of the National Employment Service were associated with those administering the Unemployment Insurance Act and provided from Vote 30 of the Department of Labour.

What action, if any, is the Department of Transport taking to provide an alternative loading dock at Caribou, Nova Scotia, for the Northeumberland Ferry service?


At this time, the Department of Transport is not considering any alternative loading dock at Caribou, Nova Scotia, for the Northumberland Ferry Service. However, an additional facility including a wharf is being built at Caribou for the fishing vessels and pleasure craft that previously used the ferry dock. This will leave the present loading dock for the use of the Northumberland Ferry Service.


1.	What are the duties of G. W. Doucet while in Paris with the Commodity, Trade Policy Branch of the Department of Industry, Trade and Commerce?
2.	What agricultural background, with particular reference to production, has he?
3.	What is his salary?


1. Mr. Doucet has been seconded from the Commodity Trade Policy Branch of the Department to the Trade Commissioner Service while he is Paris. His duties, therefore are essentially those of a Trade Commissioner and involve the promotion of Canadian agricultural exports in France and reporting on French agricultural developments. In addition, because of his knowledge and experience in agricultural trade policy within the Department, he is also engaged in agricultural trade policy issues arising between Canada and France as well as those relating to the role of France within the European Economic Community.
2.	Mr. Doucet has spent several years in the Agriculture Division, Commodity Trade Policy Branch of the Department. During this period, he has dealt with a wide range of problems relating to both domestic and international agricultural policy. Through this work he has familiarized himself with the production and marketing problems and potential of Canadian agriculture.
3.	The salary range is $13,434 to $15,725.


1.	What consideration is being given by the government to develop a Trans-Canada Computer Communications Network?
2.	What kind of measures will the government take to assure that the trunk computer communications network will be entirely Canadian owned and controlled?
3.	What immediate steps are being considered by the government to prevent future takeovers by foreign companies in the computer/communications field?
4.	To date, has the government given research and development grants to (a) Consolidated Computer Ltd. (b) IBM Canada Ltd. (c) Control Data Canada Ltd. (d) Univac Division Sperry Rand Corp. and, if so, what amount in each case?


I am informed by the Department of Communications and the Department of Industry, Trade and Commerce as follows: 1. The Government through the Computer/Communications Task Force has a comprehensive set of studies currently underway.. These studies are aimed at the orderly, rational and efficient development of the computer utilities concept in a Canadian setting. (The term "Trans-Canada Computer Communications Network" used by the Science Council in their recent report is an appropriate description for one aspect of what eventually could become an integrated network of Canadian computer utilities.) The final report of this Task Force containing its detailed recommendations is expected by the Government by the end of March 1972, at which point the Government will give it consideration.
2.	The report of the Computer/Communications Task Force will contain detailed recommendations concerning the necessity for, and appropriate measures to ensure Canadian ownership and control of the Canadian Com-puter/Communications Network.
3.	Pending the receipt of the Computer/Communica-tions Task Force's report, no special steps are currently planned in the field of computer communications to prevent takeovers by foreign companies in this area.
4.	As of April 4, 1972, the Department of Industry, Trade and Commerce has given research and development grants under the PAIT Program to: (a) Consolidated Computer Limited, $929,940; (c) Control Data Canada Limited, $6,624,833. No research and development grants have been provided under the PAIT Program to: (b) IBM Canada Limited; (d) Univac Division-Sperry Rand Corporation. Section 13 of the Industrial Research and Development Incentives Act prohibits the divulgence of information concerning any corporation.


1.	What criteria or formula are used by the government in determining its base consolidation policy?
2.	What is the final formula used in closing Canadian Forces Bases?
3.	Is it part of the procedure, prior to making the final decision, to consult with both municipal and provincial authorities in the immediate, affected localities?
April 17, 1972

4.	Does the government consider that defence spending is an effective way of maintaining economic stability, particularly in designated areas of Canada?


I am informed by the Departments of National Defence and Regional Economic Expansion as follows: 1. Many factors are taken into consideration in determining base consolidation policy. Some of these are changes in military commitments and international agreements, changes in weapons, availability of resources, reduction in force levels, as well as condition of real property and economy of base operation.
2.	When it has been decided that a base should be vacated, a public announcement is made approximately one year in advance of the closure. Operational units are moved to new locations when facilities are available, and military and civilian staffs prepare the base for disposal. If the property is to be declared surplus to Crown Assets Disposal Corporation, the Corporation is alerted to the basic plan. If the base is not disposed of by the closure date, the facilities are placed on a "caretaker status" and a rear party is charged with its security and care after that date. As base activities run down, military personnel excess to requirements are posted to vacancies at other bases and civilian personnel are offered vacancies, if available, elsewhere in the Public Service; and Canada Manpower Centres and the Department of Manpower and Immigration provide assistance for those who do not remain in the public service.
3.	Local municipal and provincial officials are advised of the decision before the public announcement is made.
4.	Yes, provided the primary purposes of the spending are not jeopardized. Defence spending, like other forms of expenditure can, in principle, be used to help maintain economic stability.

2.	Does the government have any information as to the length of time required for research to determine how alternative voting schemes would affect the results of votes in the General Assembly?
3.	Will the federal government advise if research will be carried out to determine the influence Canada would have under an alternative voting scheme and, if so (a) who will carry out the research (b) when will it be commenced?


1. During the 25th Session of the United Nations General Assembly, a resolution was passed which requested the Secretary-General to invite Member States to communicate to him, before July 1, 1971, their views and suggestions on the review of the Charter of the United Nations. There was no request for submission of specific proposals concerning Charter review.
2. Because of the great number of factors which could be taken into account in any alternate voting scheme, and the diversity of the United Nations membership, an indefinite length of time would be required for research to

determine how such schemes would affect the results of votes in the General Assembly.
3. Alternate voting schemes have been examined by some scholars and institutions interested in suggesting changes in UN voting methods. At present the Government has no plans for additional research in this area.


Has the General Assembly of the United Nations passed a resolution calling on member nations to submit proposals for revision of the United Nations Charter and, if so, will the federal government consider the advisability of making representations to the effect that voting not be based on the one-nation one-vote idea, but rather on the basis of (a) population (b) national wealth (c) standard of living (d) literacy, or some other criteria or combination of these factors?


On December 11, 1970 the United Nations, with Canada casting an assenting vote, passed Resolution 2697 entitled "Need to consider suggestions regarding review of the Charter of the UN." This resolution requested Member States to communicate suggestions on the review of the UN Charter. The Government plans to submit a reply to the Secretary-General, but has not yet decided whether or not comments on an alternative voting scheme will be part of that reply.


Will the federal government consider the advisability of sponsoring a resolution proposing the revision of the United Nations Charter so that the U.N. response to aggression will be automatic and not the subject of delay through prolonged debate?


The government is not considering sponsoring such a resolution. The UN Special Committee on Defining Aggression has had its mandate extended for a fifth time but an agreement among member states on a definition of aggression does not appear to be forthcoming in the foreseeable future. Until such a definition can be agreed upon it is doubtful if any revision of the UN Charter in this area would be acceptable to the majority of members.


1.	How many Library Centres has Canada throughout the world for cultural exchange and how many additional Library Centres are contemplated?

books may be borrowed. No additional library centres are being considered at the present time.
2. The United States Information Service maintains an Information Centre with a library in Ottawa. The Goethe Institute, which is supported by the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany, maintains cultural centres in Ottawa, Montreal and Toronto. The Alliance Frangaise, which receives support from the Government of France, has 23 branches in Canada, which all have libraries. Embassies and High Commissions of many other countries in Ottawa have reading rooms in their chancery premises open to the general public.


During the fiscal year 1971-72, did the federal government give financial aid for the construction of the Trans-Canada Highway from Montmagny, Quebec to the New Brunswick border and, if so, under what agreement and in what amount?


Yes. Under the terms of the Trans-Canada Highway Agreement whereby payment of accounts for work completed to December 31, 1970, could be claimed, subject to audit, until May 31, 1971. The amount to date during the 19711972 fiscal year is $7,506.82.


In the years 1957 and 1967, what percentage of the total money income was received by the (a) lowest one-fifth (b) second lowest fifth (c) third lowest fifth (d) fourth lowest fifth (e) highest fifth of all family units?


Statistics Canada reports that: If all families and unattached individuals are ranked by the size of their money income and divided into 5 groups of equal number or quintiles, the share of money income received by each one fifth of family units was estimated to be as follows:
	1957	1967*
Lowest quintile	4.2%	4.2%Second quintile	11.9%	11.4%Middle quintile	18.0%	17.8%Fourth quintile	24.5%	24.6%Highest quintile	41.4%	42.0%
Includes farm families who were excluded in the 1957 estimates; their inclusion affects the figures only to the extent of lowering the share of income going to the lower fifths by a few tenths of a percentage point and raising the share of income of the top fifth by thp same figure. It is estimated that if the figures had been completely comparable, the distribution would have been substantially the same.


How many persons were drawing Unemployment Insurance benefits as of January 31,1972?


Statistics Canada reports that: Information as requested is not available. However, on January 31, 1972 there were 826,996 claimants registered for unemployment insurance benefits.


1.	How long has Canada been a member of the International Civil Aviation Organization and what are the obligations of membership?
2.	How many countries belong to the International Civil Aviation Organization and are individual countries bound by the recommendations of the majority of the membership?
3.	Has the ICAO made any recommendations about skyjacking and, if so, what are they?


1. The International Civil Aviation Organization, located in Montreal, was created by the Convention on International Civil Aviation (the Chicago Convention of 1944) which was signed by Canada on December 7, 1944. ICAO officially came into existence on April 4, 1947, with Canada as a charter member. The aims and objectives of ICAO are to develop the principles and techniques of international air navigation and to foster the planning and development of international air transport so as to: (a) ensure the safe and orderly growth of international civil aviation throughout the world; (b) encourage the arts of aircraft design and operation for peaceful purposes; (c) encourage the development of airways, airports and air navigation facilities for international civil aviation; (d) meet the needs of the peoples of the world for safe, regular, efficient and economical air transport; (e) prevent economic waste caused by unreasonable competition; (f) ensure that the rights of contracting states are fully respected and that every contracting state has a fair opportunity to operate international airlines; (g) avoid discrimination between contracting states; (h) promote safety of flight in international air navigation; (i) promote generally the development of all aspects of international civil aeronautics.
Membership in ICAO obligates states to comply with the provisions of the Convention on International Civil Aviation. Members are also obliged to finance the operation of the Organization through annual assessments; Canada's 1972 assessment is $US278,959.29. Canada, as host government, also underwrites a substantial part of the costs of the space rented for the ICAO Headquarters Building. ICAO has decided to move into new premises in Montreal in late 1973 or early 1974 and the Canadian Government has agreed to make an annual grant of $1.1 million towards the cost of renting this building.
2. One hundred and twenty-two countries are members of ICAO.
There is no mechanism for ensuring that member states adhere to the recommendations of the ICAO Assembly

April 17, 1972

(all member states) or the ICAO Council (27 member states). Last April the United States of America and Canada co-sponsored a draft convention providing for the enforcement of international legal obligations relating to unlawful interference with civil aviation but the ICAO Assembly transferred this proposal to its inactive list of subjects because of opposition from a number of member states.
3. ICAO has been actively involved with the question of skyjacking and other related matters affecting the safety of international civil aviation for some time. Under ICAO auspices the Convention on Offences and Certain Other Acts Committed on Board Aircraft was signed in Tokyo on September 14, 1963. Canada ratified this convention on November 7, 1969. The Convention came into effect on December 4, 1969.
The Seventeenth Session (Extraordinary) of the ICAO Assembly, held in Montreal from July 16 to 30, 1970, had for its agenda the single item calling for the "development of adequate security specifications and practices, for application by ICAO States in international civil aviation, aimed at the protection of air passengers, civil aviation personnel and civil aircraft by (a) preventing criminal action of any kind that may endanger the safety of air transport and (b) consideration of arrangements under which those responsible for criminal actions endangering civil air transport can be brought to justice." Two Diplomatic Conferences on matters related to skyjacking followed which resulted in: (a) the Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Seizure of Aircraft signed at The Hague on December 16, 1970; (b) the Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Civil Aviation signed at Montreal on September 23, 1971. Canada will ratify The Hague and Montreal Conventions as soon as Parliament approves the necessary amendments to the Criminal Code tabled recently in the House of Commons. Neither of these conventions have beeen ratified by the required number of countries to have it come into effect.
The ICAO Council has also set up a Committee on Unlawful Interference with International Civil Aviation and its Facilities to deal with problems of (1) unalwful seizure of aircraft and (2) sabotage or armed attack directed against aircraft used in international air transport or ground facilities used by international air transport. Canada is not a member of this committee.


What increase in sales of grains and oilseeds is anticipated as a result of the new federal financial incentives program during 1972-73?


The new Federal Market Development Program for Grains and Oilseeds, of which financial assistance to the private sector of the grains industry is a major element, has the twofold aim of maintaining the level of Canadian sales in present markets as well as locating and developing new opportunities in areas where our commercial sales can be increased.
Questions
Activities are being concentrated on those markets in which we believe prospects are best for establishing a solid commercial footing. Because the central thrust of the program is to assist private firms, associations and similar entities to identify and develop viable commercial market opportunities, the increase in sales resulting from the program will be the cumulative total of the results of all the individual projects. Until more experience is gained in the execution of such projects it is not possible to anticipate with any precision what that total will be during 1972-73.
Although in a limited number of cases the impact of projects may be indirect and therefore difficult to measure in terms of increased sales, in most instances the sponsors of projects are required to show convincing evidence that support of their project will yield a very high ratio of benefit (i.e. a sustained increase in Canadian grains and oilseeds sales) in relation to cost.


1.	Will the government consider the advisability of providing municipalities with support funds to carry out a program regarding hard-core welfare recipients who have previously been rejected from employment and are considered unemployable?
2.	Will the government consider the advisability of providing incentives to welfare recipients to become gainfully employed?


1. Under Part III of the Canada Assistance Plan, the federal government will share in the cost to provinces and municipalities of undertaking work activity programs to prepare for the entry or the return to employment of persons in need or persons likely to become persons in need who, because of environmental, personal or family reasons, have unusual difficulty in obtaining or retaining employment or in improving, through technical, vocational or rehabilitation programs, their ability to obtain or retain employment.
2. Provincial legislation defines the levels of income and assets permitted welfare recipients, and the trend is to provide larger earning exemptions for recipients who work.


Will the government advise if the program for introduction of the metric system will be co-ordinated with that of other countries embarking on the same system and in particular with that of the United States?


The Metric Commission is keeping in close touch with the developments in the United States and other countries in regard to the adoption of metric standards and measurements and is studying the extent to which programs of conversion in individual industries will require to be co-ordinated with similar programs in the United States.
