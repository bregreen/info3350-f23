Mr. Speaker, I should like to call the attention of hon. members to the presence in your gallery of a young man from Saskatoon, Danny Musgrove, who is this year's National Easter Seal "Timmy" and a real inspiration to the children he represents. He is, I think, the first national "Timmy" from outside Ontario. Despite a couple of artificial limbs he plays goal and defence. He is able to manage the trombone as he did on the Tommy Banks show a week or so ago, and just last week when the Silver Broom championship curling tournament was being opened in Saskatoon he teamed up in an important way with the Governor General. He held the broom and the Governor General threw the stone which landed on the button. He is accompanying the Prime Minister later today to London, Ontario. I thought I should bring the presence of Danny Musgrove to the attention of the House.


Hear, hear.


Second report of Standing Committee on Miscellaneous Estimates-Mr. Leblanc (Laurier).
[Editor's Note: For text of above report, see today's Votes and Proceedings.]
I have the honour to inform the House that the Clerk of the House has laid upon the table the first report of the Clerk of Petitions.


Mr. Speaker, in view of the escape record at Millhaven Penitentiary, 16 inmates from the minimum security institution, five of whom are still at large, and 20 from the alleged maximum security institution, in view of the current sit-down strike at Millhaven, and in view of the concern expressed by a spokesman for penitentiary guards with regard to the rehabilitation program at the institution, I ask leave of the House to move, seconded by the hon. member for Fron-tenac-Lennox and Addington (Mr. Alkenbrack):
That the Standing Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs be directed to study security and rehabilitation policies and personnel at Millhaven Penitentiary.


The motion proposed by the hon. member is put forward under the terms of Standing Order 43. Is there unanimous consent?


Agreed.


No.


There is not unanimity. The motion cannot be put.


Mr. Speaker, under Standing Order 43, I rise to request the unanimous consent of the House to propose a motion on an important and urgent matter.
Since it is impossible for members of this House to identify those of their colleagues who oppose the proposing of a motion under Standing Order 43, since this can throw doubt on the integrity of hon. members who are suspected, often wrongly, of having opposed a motion, and given that I am not questioning the courage and convictions of each of my colleagues, I move, seconded by the hon. member for Kamouraska (Mr. Dionne):
That the member or members who oppose the proposing of a motion under Standing Order 43 be required to identify themselves clearly by standing up when the Chair asks if there is unanimous consent.


The House has heard the hon. member's motion. Under Standing Order 43, the motion requires the unanimous consent of the House. Is there unanimous consent?

March 21, 1973
Proposed Pickering Airport


Yes.


No.


There is not unanimous consent; the motion therefore cannot be put.


Mr. Speaker, under the terms of Standing Order 43, I would move the following motion related to the government's failure to honour its promise to set up an independent study group to permit citizen participation in the Pickering airport decision. The motion, seconded by the hon. member for Scarborough East (Mr. Stackhouse), reads as follows:
Whereas the Minister of Transport announced on January 30 the government's intention to proceed with expropriation for the new Toronto airport at Pickering but at the same time announced that an independent study group would be set up to permit the public to participate in the question of the airport; and since the minister stated at that time that it was the government's intention that the study group should report within 12 months; and whereas over seven weeks have elapsed since that statement with no announcement of the study group's formation and therefore still no opportunity for the citizens of the Toronto region to participate in this important decision, which by the minister's own admission-


Order, please. Would the hon. member resume his seat? The hon. member is making a speech. We can easily get into difficulties if motions under Standing Order 43 are argued. I believe it is well established practice that dn hon. member should not argue his case but he should indicate as briefly as possible the subject of his proposed motion and come to the point so that the Chair can seek the views of the House.


I shall put the motion very briefly, Mr. Speaker. It is:
That the matter to which I have just referred be placed immediately before the Standing Committee on Transport and Communications for consideration and action.


The House has heard the motion proposed by the hon. member for St. Paul's. It requires unanimous consent. Is there unanimous consent?


Agreed.


No.


There is not unanimity. The motion cannot be put.


Mr. Speaker, pursuant to Standing Order

41(2) I wish to lay on the table of the House in both official languages, pursuant to section 19 of the Textile and clothing Board Act, copies of two reports, the first respecting men's and boys' shirts and the second respecting acrylic yarns.


Mr. Speaker, under Standing Order 43,1 ask the unanimous consent of the House to discuss a pressing matter.
Knowing that hon. members are aware of the precarious financial situation of at least 40 per cent of the Canadian people, I wish to move a motion intended to help the Canadian consumers fight inflation. I move, seconded by the hon. member for Bellechasse (Mr. Lambert):
That this House apply immediately a compensated discount of 10 per cent on the retail sale of all basic food products, including milk, bread, potatoes, some meats and vegetables, to be determined jointly by the authorities of the Departments of Finance and National Health and Welfare, and that the Standing Committee on Finance, Commerce and Economic Affairs make an inquiry to determine the technical process by which this discount will be applied, and table its report for approval in the House in 60 days.


Hon. members have heard the motion of the hon. member. Pursuant to Standing Order 43, this motion requires unanimous consent of the House. Is there unanimous consent?


Yes.


No.


There being no unanimous consent, the motion therefore cannot be put.


(Questions answered orally are indicated by an asterisk.)
Is the present government considering any financial assistance for grain storage facilities to farmers or existing grain elevators?


Yes.

March 21, 1973___________COMMONS DEBATES_____________________2435


What does the government consider the poverty level to be and (a) how many Canadians are now living below this level (b) how many Canadians on fixed incomes live below this level?


As far as Statistics Canada is concerned: There is no existing official statistical concept of poverty in Canada. However, Statistics Canada has established low income cut-offs which have been used to delineate low-income families from other units. For the year 1971 the low income cut-offs were as follows: 1 person unit, $2,013; 2 person unit, $3,355; 3 person unit, $4,026; 4 person unit, $4,697; 5 and 5+ person unit, $5,368; (a) Using the above low income cut-offs Statistics Canada estimates that the incidence of low income among unattached individuals was 37.6% and among families of two or more persons 15.9 per cent in 1971. This translates into approximately 3.9 million low income persons. (These data are the revised estimates originally published in Cat. No. 13-206 Income Distributions by Size in Canada, Preliminary Estimates, 1971.); (b) It is not clear how "living on fixed incomes" is being defined. However, the following unpublished estimates are available from the same source as quoted above: In 1971, 53.9 per cent or approximately 351,000 low income unattached individuals received their major source of income from transfer payments; in the same year 49.1 per cent or approximately
400,000	low income families reported government transfer payments as their major source of income.

It must be remembered that the Canada Pension Plan can be amended only with the consent of two-thirds of the provinces with at least two-thirds of the population of Canada. As yet, it has not been possible to obtain the necessary concurrence.

How many surveys and forms have been distributed by Statistics Canada to small businesses in Canada in each of the past four years (1968-1972)?


Statistics Canada
reports that: Commercial businesses with less than 20 employees, and with relatively small total revenues and sales are classified as "small" business for statistical purposes. To minimize the response burden for them, Statistics Canada provides small businesses with abbreviated survey questionnaires. In addition, the use of sampling in some surveys means that reliable information on all small firms can be obtained by surveying only 5 per cent to 15 per cent of the total, the sample size depending on the particular survey in question. Over the years 1968 to 1972 inclusive, the average number of different surveys designed to collect data from small firms varied from 56 to 59. Most questionnaires are designed for surveys of specific industries and the maximum number of Statistics Canada surveys a small firm engaged in a single activity would be subject to in one year is four. Periodically, Statistics Canada asks some of the smaller firms for information on the nature, location and organization of their business in order to maintain its survey mailing lists and reporting structures up to date.

Are (a) supply teachers (b) school secretaries eligible to claim unemployment insurance during July and August and, if so, will UIC send them cheques at their summer addresses?


Supply teachers or substitutes as well as school secretaries are eligible for benefits during July and August provided that they have at least eight weeks of insurable employment and will perform no work and receive no pay from their employer in respect of a period of seven consecutive days following their lay off or separation. Where a mailing address differs from the address shown on the Separation Certificate, an investigation is made to determine whether the claimant is in fact available for work. If it is determined that there is a reasonable relationship between the job opportunities in both the claimants mailing address and the address on the Separation Certificate benefit warrants will be mailed to the summer address, provided the claimant fulfills the other requirements for entitlement to benefit.

Will the government consider changing Immigration regulations announced in November, 1972, so that those from other countries who were actually in Canada prior to the date of the said announcement can apply for landed immigrant status from within this country?


The Government is not prepared to restore Section 34 of the Immigration Regulations nor does it plan to make wholesale exceptions to the withdrawal of the right to apply for landed immigrant status from within Canada. The Department will continue to process those applications submitted before the revocation of Section 34. It will also consider those cases where there is evidence that a person called at an immigration office prior to the revocation to submit an application but where the application could not be dealt with. Sympathetic consideration will also be given to genuine political refugees as well as to cases where there are strong humanitarian and compassionate circumstances.

1 What hotels or motels have been insured by the Export Development Corporation under Section 34 of the Export Development Act and for each contract (a) in what country is the project situated (b) who is the owner of the project (c) what are the category or categories of insurance (d) what is the applicable amount of insurance in relation to the total cost of the project in

figures and percentage terms and with respect to each category of insurance, rates charged and term?
2.	In what way were exporters in Canada benefited by each project so insured?
3.	Has any claim been made to date under one or more of the contracts?
4.	Is it proposed to issue any further contracts of insurance with respect to foreign investments in hotels or motels or similar projects under Section 34 of the Export Development Act?


Export Development Corporation states that: 1. It has insured under section 34 of the Export Development Act a Canadian investment abroad in respect of one hotel; it has not insured a Canadian investment abroad in respect of a motel; (a) the project is situated in St. Lucia, British West Indies; (b) the principal owner and insured investor is Livingston Holdings Limited, Tillsonburg, Ontario; (c) as to the categories of the foreign investment insurance cover provided for the hotel investment, the insurance is against loss of or in respect of the investment by reason of the three risks of (i) government action that prohibits or restricts the transfer of capital or dividends from the country, (ii) expropriation, and (iii) war, revolution or insurrection; and (d) with regard to part (d) of the question numbered 1, (i) the contract of insurance in question covers 85 per cent of the amount of Canadian investment in the hotel. EDC receives as a matter of trade confidence particulars of the proposed Canadian investments abroad for which its foreign investment insurance is sought, and so as not to break faith with the investor, does not publish specific figures for the amount of each insurance contract or the cost of each project. There is often keen competition between intending investors for the approval of the government of the country concerned; and (ii) for each of the three categories of insurance mentioned above, the premium rate charged is an annual rate of 0.3 per cent, and for each the term of the cover is 15 years.
2.	The benefit to exporters in Canada lies in contracts for construction and for Canadian goods and services for the hotel, together worth approximately $1.8 million.
3.	There has not been any claim made to date under the contract of investment insurance in question or under any other EDC contract of foreign investment insurance.
4.	EDC is prepared to examine all applications for foreign investment cover and accepts those which meet all its criteria with particular emphasis on the benefits of the proposal to both the economy of Canada and the economy of the host government. These criteria would apply to foreign investments by Canadians in both hotels or motels.
