Mr. Speaker, I rise on a question of privilege which I think will be of interest to all members of the House. I am sure that after I have related the facts Your Honour will find in my favour.
The Minister of Manpower and Immigration (Mr. Andras) made a statement on November 7 dealing with the Unemployment Insurance Act and it was duly reported in the Globe and Mail on Thursday, November 8. One never likes to question the Globe and Mail, but apparently statements which should have been attributed to me have been attributed to the minister.
I suggest that the statements are of some significance and I would not want to embarrass the minister. In the article, the Minister of Manpower and Immigration is reported to have said:
I should like to say that one of the most disastrous things we have done in this House is to remove the $800-million statutory ceiling because this means that the members of the opposition and the people of Canada can never tell in what state the Unemployment Insurance Fund is at any particular time unless the minister stands up and makes a statement.
But that is not all. I questioned the disincentive aspects of the bill. In that regard the statement is reported to have been made by the minister:
This is a question which has been asked by employers across this country who advise that the disincentive aspects of the bill, in fact, are eroding the free enterprise system.
There is a further statement of some consequence that I think would be embarrassing to the minister. I indicated that because of government mismanagement the minister 0 had found it necessary to increase the employee contribution to $1.40. The following statement is also attributed to the minister:
This is an unwarranted tax because of government mismanagement.
Finally, there is this last and most important statement. I reviewed the entire matter and, keeping in mind the lack of significant projections as to the cost of the scheme and the amount of the benefits, I concluded with this statement which is also attributed to the minister:
In every instance the government is wrong and that is why I say this bill which, in the first instance the members of this House thought would be a good bill, is a fraud of some significant proportions upon the House of Commons and the people of Canada.
I think this is a matter of some significance. I know I speak on behalf of the Minister of Manpower and Immigration when I say that this is certainly a question of privilege. Through Your Honour's good offices, perhaps the Globe and Mail could be instructed to make another run at the matter in order to show the true facts. I am sure the minister may have some misgivings about the work of the Unemployment Insurance Commission, but I do not think he has the gall or the nerve to stand up and make the statements I did.


Order, please. The minister will, of course, be recognized, even though I am not sure whether the hon. member's question of privilege is raised with tongue in cheek. Whether it is or not, I remind hon. members there is a requirement that notice ought to be given to the Chair. It seems to me hon. members have a tendency to disregard the provisions of the Standing Order which insist that notice ought to be given in advance of questions of privilege or of motions under Standing Order 26. I would hope all hon. members will keep that in mind. It is helpful to the Chair. Having said that, I appreciate the way the matter was brought before the House by the hon. member and I have no hesitation in allowing the minister to comment.


Mr. Speaker, it will be no surprise when I say that this is one of the rare occasions I would join with the hon. member for Hamilton West (Mr. Alexander), but for slightly different reasons. I totally disassociate myself and my name from those remarks of the member. Although we do not often agree, I find myself very much in parallel with the hon. member's thinking, but for slightly different reasons.


Mr. Speaker, I should like to remind hon. members that the day after tomorrow is Remembrance Day. It will mark the fifty-fifth anniversary of the ceasefire in the first world war.
It is the day our country officially observes as the day of remembrance for those Canadian men and women who gave their lives in the defence of freedom. In two world wars and the Korean campaign nearly 115,000 Canadians
7692

November 9, 1973
Remembrance Day
made the supreme sacrifice. This Sunday, at 11 a.m., that sacrifice will be remembered not only in Ottawa but all across Canada and in many other parts of the world. Our allies also keep November 11a sacred day to pay tribute to those who laid down their lives so that we and our children can live a serene and rewarding life.
There are many vacant chairs in Canadian homes today which belonged to fathers, husbands and sons who never came home from the wars. There are also many chairs which are filled by those who bear physical evidence of the scars and wounds of battle. These, also, we remember. Not just on November 11, but all through the year. The memorials we have erected to the fallen, both at home and abroad, pay dignified and worthy tribute to those whose names they commemorate. We are proud of them just as we are proud of the ways in which the people of this country have always acknowledged the debt which is owed to those who survived.
I feel that Canada, in her remembrance of both the living and the dead, has respected and honoured those who served in as fine a way as any country in the world. I feel we have caught the torch which was thrown to us in the immortal words of John McCrae. Let us for ever hold it high.


Hear, hear!


Mr. Speaker, on behalf of my party I am happy to endorse the statement just made by the Minister of Veterans Affairs. As a matter of fact, as Your Honour will recall, I spoke to you this morning to indicate that I intended to rise to make a motion on this subject. I therefore heartily endorse the minister's statement.
I hope the ceremonies on the fifty-fifth anniversary of the ending of the first world war will remind the government that there are still some inequities in the veterans legislation. I know that the 52 members of the House of Commons who are war veterans realize this and will dedicate themselves to fulfilling the obligations that successive prime ministers have undertaken to the veterans of Canada.
I might take this opportunity to call the attention of the House to the fact that we still have among us a member of the House of Commons who is also a veteran of the first world war in the person of the distinguished right hon. member for Prince Albert.


Hear, hear!


Mr. Speaker, I should like to associate the New Democratic Party with the remarks made by the Minister of Veterans Affairs concerning Remembrance Day. Those who will march in the parades to be held across Canada on November 11 will be remembering intimately their comrades who died in the service of their country, those who suffered in that service, all those who took part in wars which they and the country believed were necessary for the survival of our democratic system and our nation.
There are many young people today who will watch these parades with some interest and little knowledge. I hope that Remembrance Day will direct the attention of

those Canadians who have no knowledge of the wars to the efforts that Canada can well make by playing an independent role in the world and trying to fulfil the obligations that those who fought and died for Canada in two great wars were trying to accomplish. We can do this effectively and efficiently by remaining independent and maintaining a peacekeeping role throughout the world, thus eliminating the suffering, loss and grief caused those who gave so much in two world wars and in Korea.


Mr. Speaker, like our colleagues in this House, we are very happy to join the Minister of Veterans Affairs (Mr. MacDonald) and all the people of Canada in paying tribute next Monday to those who died for their country.
If Canada still enjoys the total freedom that many other countries do not have, perhaps we owe it to those who are no longer among us or who gave their health and their limbs in the two previous world wars.
In the name of my colleagues and the Canadian population, I should like to thank those who gave us yesterday the freedom which we enjoy today.


Mr. Speaker, on November 1 I informed the House that it was my intention to meet with the Secretary General of the United Nations in New York the following day to discuss with him the composition of the emergency force for service in the Middle East. My discussions with the Secretary General were useful and served to clarify some of the outstanding issues.
The same evening agreement was reached in the Security Council authorizing the Secretary General to consult with potential contributors, including Canada and Poland who were to provide contingents which would have particular responsibility for the provision of logistic support. On November 5 following my return from the United Nations I tabled in the House the text of the Security Council agreement along with the texts of notes exchanged between the Secretary General and our ambassador to the United Nations.	f
Our ambassador has since been holding discussions with the Secretary General, at Mr. Waldheim's request, concerning the organization and composition of the logistics element of the United Nations Emergency Force. Polish representatives have also participated in these more detailed discussions. Meanwhile, evaluation teams were dispatched to Cairo to assess the requirement on the ground.
In the light of the discussions to date, I wish to inform the House that agreement has been reached on the first phase of the deployment of the Canadian contingent. A signals unit which will provide communications for the United Nations Emergency Force will begin its departure
November 9, 1973

from Canada within the next few days. We understand the Poles will be dispatching an engineer unit as the first element in their contribution. In the meantime, the Secretary General is awaiting the final reports of the evaluation teams and continuing his discussions with Canadian and Polish representatives to determine the next stages of the logistics deployment. These discussions have, of course, even greater urgency than heretofore in light of the news that progress has been made in securing a truce and in initiating negotiations which we all hope will lead to a permanent settlement.
As Canada will shortly be dispatching a signals unit to the Middle East, I propose to bring forward in the House on Tuesday, November 13, the resolution seeking the approval of parliament for the government's decision to participate in the UNEF.


Mr. Speaker, the statement made by the minister indicates that the government is preparing to go ahead with a contingent for the peace force in the Middle East. We say bon voyage and best wishes to the signals upit about to leave Canada within the next few days.
The encouraging developments this week in the Middle East make it difficult for any responsible observer to suggest any posture on our part that could in any way add an extra dimension of difficulty to the situation. However, there remain some fundamental questions as to why our government pursued participation so vehemently and why the minister felt it necessary to ensure that Canada was part of the peace force. Surely our nation's foreign policies are not so fragile as to require the biannual injections of peace force participation in order to stay healthy.
My colleagues and I will have more specific matters to raise with reference not only to our participation in the Middle East peacekeeping force but on the entire question of peace force use and our role within peace forces when the resolution is brought forward for debate on Tuesday. That Canada should respond to international requests for assistance is beyond question; that Canada should insist on participating in every international peace force is truly open to question.
[ Translation]
Mr. Speaker, I hope that next Tuesday's debate will be a real one and not only a series of monologues like in the past.
If the minister really wants the agreement of this House, I hope he will give us all the necessary data and inform us of the position of the government and of its policy as regards a peacekeeping force. This is the only way that we shall have a useful debate; otherwise, it would be only a useless exercise.


Mr. Speaker, we have made it clear in the past that decisions such as the decision to participate in peacekeeping operations are of such importance that they should be referred to parliament for approval. We therefore welcome the proposed debate on the resolution next Tuesday.
Veterans Land Act
At a time when the Congress of the United States is seeking to assert control of the legislative branch over major international decisions, we in Canada should make it crystal clear that although the initial decision and the negotiation of details rest with the government, the ultimate decision on major issues of foreign policy must be retained by parliament representing the people as a whole. This is essential to the working of parliamentary democracy.
We will leave comment on the decision to participate in the peacekeeping force in support of logistics services and the details of that contribution to the debate when our position can be more fully explained. Suffice it to say that in our view the more hopeful developments in the last few hours in the Middle East would have been impossible without the existence of the United Nations and the willingness of nations to make a contribution to peacekeeping forces.


Hear, hear!


Mr. Speaker, naturally we approve any attempt to restore peace wherever need be. However, we are especially pleased to see that the government will permit the House to debate this matter so that its policy may really reflect the opinion of the whole Canadian population relating to the part that our country must play in the race, if such an expression may be used, towards peace in the world and in the Middle East in particular.


Mr. Speaker, Sunday being Armistice Day, I hope the House will agree to a motion which I should like to present under the terms of Standing Order 43.1 therefore move, seconded by the hon. member for Humber-St. George's-St. Barbe (Mr. Marshall):
That this House requests that the Minister of Veterans Affairs give urgent consideration to the amending of the Veterans Land Act regulations to permit veterans to acquire small holdings, even if the main purpose of most of the older veterans now applying for loans under the Veterans Land Act is to meet their housing requirements, it being the view of this House that entitlement to a piece of this land ought to be the right of any veteran.


Hear, hear!


The House has heard the motion proposed by the hon. member for Winnipeg North Centre under the terms of Standing Order 43. Is there unanimous consent?


Agreed.


My understanding is that there is unanimous consent. Is there unanimous consent?


Agreed.

Motion agreed to.
Mr. Speaker, I should like to present a motion under Standing Order 43. As the Manitoba government has stated this week that it wants no part of the Deer Lodge Military Hospital transfer due to internal problems and a poor federal government financial settlement, I move, seconded by the hon. member for Middlesex (Mr. Frank):
That the many representations made by veterans protesting handover of veterans hospitals to provincial and/or municipal authorities be referred to the Standing Committee on Veterans Affairs for investigation.


Is there unanimous consent?

No.


There is not, and the motion cannot be put.

Mr. Speaker, under Standing Order 43, I ask the unanimous consent of the House to discuss a most urgent and pressing matter.
Seconded by the hon. member for Shefford (Mr. Rondeau), I move:
That a special committee of the House be set up to study the serious problem of the many layoffs at Lauzon because of a steel supply shortage and to make necessary recommendations in order to correct the situation and mostly to prevent it from growing worse.


The House has heard the motion of the hon. member. Under Standing Order 43, this motion requires the unanimous consent of the House. Is there unanimous consent?


Agreed.


No.


There is no unanimous consent. The motion cannot be put.

[ English]


Mr. Speaker, I rise under the provisions of Standing Order 43 on a matter of urgent and pressing necessity. In view of the fact that many weekly newspapers in eastern Ontario, some over 100 years old, are being threatened with extinction because of the fact that the pulp and paper industry, and the distributors and suppliers of newsprint, are refusing to supply this basic necessity to the papers concerned, thus creating a situation in which one of the fundamental natural laws of the land, enshrined in the Canadian Bill of Rights, Part I, section 1(f), being "freedom of the press," is put in jeopardy in that there will be no press, I move, seconded by the hon. member for Grenville-Carleton (Mr. Baker):
That the government not grant any export licences to producers of newsprint, nor allow the selling of Canadian-made newsprint to foreign markets, until supplies of newsprint are guaranteed to all Canadian newspapers, weekly or otherwise, and any other Canadian customers.


Hear, hear!


Is there unanimous consent?


Agreed.


No.


There is not unanimity.


Mr. Speaker, in light of what appear to be scandalous inequities in the constituency allocation of funds for local initiatives projects, I ask leave of the House, under Standing Order 43, to move, seconded by the hon. member for Fraser Valley West (Mr. Rose):
That the subject of the funds allocated to constituencies for local initiatives projects and the criteria employed in making such allocations be immediately referred to the Standing Committee on Labour, Manpower and Immigration for study and report not later than December 2, 1973.


Is there unanimous consent?

No.


There is not unanimity.
November 9, 1973


Mr. Speaker, I rise under the provisions of Standing Order 43 regarding a matter of urgent and pressing necessity, namely, the plight of some war veterans. I ask unanimous consent to move, seconded by the hon. member for Halton-Wentworth (Mr. Kempling):
That the many representations made by veterans showing grievance against the delays in adjudication of pension applications be referred to the Standing Committee on Veterans Affairs for investigation.


Is there unanimous consent?


Agreed.


No.


There is not unanimous consent.


Mr. Speaker, I rise under the provisions of Standing Order 43 to ask unanimous consent to move, seconded by the hon. member for Humber-St. George's-St. Barbe (Mr. Marshall):
That the many representations made by federal nurses employed in veterans hospitals protesting the arbitral award of the government with regard to pay matters be referred to the Standing Committee on Veterans Affairs.


Is there unanimous consent?


Agreed.


No.


There is not unanimity.


Mr. Speaker, I rise to seek unanimous consent under Standing Order 43 to present a motion of urgent and pressing necessity. In view of the fact that the Minister of Transport (Mr. Marchand), in spite of an undertaking to this House two weeks ago, has so far been unable to give any statement to the House assuring the House and the people of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick of the continued operation of the Bay of Fundy ferry service I move, seconded by the hon. member for Saint John-Lancaster (Mr. Bell):
That this House instruct the government to enter into an arrangement with CPR to assure the continued operation of that service, made on a twice daily sailing for another six months, and
Newsprint Supplies
initiate a study by the proper authorities to determine most appropriate means for assuring continued permanent service.


Is there unanimous consent?


Agreed.


No.


There is not unanimity.


Mr. Speaker, under the provisions of Standing Order 43 I rise on a matter of urgent and pressing necessity to ask the unanimous consent of the House to move a motion. In view of the lengthy delays of the Unemployment Insurance Commission in disposing of the appeals of the CPR shopcraft workers at Moose Jaw and CNR dockworkers at North Sydney, Nova Scotia, and the hardships suffered by these people, I move, seconded by the hon. member for Cape Breton-The Sydneys (Mr. Muir):
That the question of the rights of the shopcraft and dockworkers to receive unemployment insurance benefits be referred to the Standing Committee on Manpower and Immigration.


Is there unanimous consent?


Agreed.


No.


There is not unanimity. The motion cannot be put.


Mr. Speaker, under Standing Order 26 I ask leave to adjourn the House for the purpose of discussing a specific and important matter requiring urgent consideration, namely, the withholding by Canadian manufacturers and distributors of newsprint, the diverting of newsprint to foreign markets, and the failure to guarantee the supply of newsprint by the papermaking and paper distributing companies in Canada to the weekly newspapers of eastern Ontario, thereby constituting a danger to the freedom of the press in that there will be no press in this vital area.


As the hon. member knows, he has given the Chair short notice under the terms of Standing Order

November 9, 1973
Oral Questions
26(2) which stipulates that a member is required to give at least two hours notice by written statement prior to the opening of a sitting of the matter proposed to be discussed and, further, that if the urgent matter is not then known, the member shall give his written statement to Mr. Speaker as soon as practicable but before the opening of the sitting.
The hon. member did give me notice before the opening of the sitting and I am prepared to look at the matter when I have a moment to do so.
I think the hon. member knows the difficulty of the Chair in relation to the granting of leave to put a motion under Standing Order 26. Many aspects of the matter have to be taken into account according to the provisions of the Standing Order. The matter will be looked into within the next hour or so and a decision will be given from the Chair later, either at one o'clock or at two o'clock.


Mr. Speaker, I wish to direct a question to the Minister of State for Urban Affairs. In view of the fact the minister personally gave an undertaking on September 12 to the Native Council of Canada that he and his officials would consult with them fully, and on a continuing basis, in the development of a housing policy for Metis and non-status Indians, can the minister explain how he intends this policy of consultation to succeed when a senior official of CMHC, Walter Rudnicki, is summarily dismissed from his position because he did exactly what the minister promised, that is, honoured the minister's commitment to allow the native people of Canada a meaningful-


Order, please. The hon. member will agree with the Chair, I am sure, that a question asked in those terms is really argument, but the minister would perhaps want to reply to that part of the hon. member's question which is not argument and the hon. member could then ask a supplementary or supplementaries.


Mr. Speaker, many of the premises of the question are not correct. In reply to the principal part of the question about consultation with the Native Council, Metis groups and non-status Indian groups, there have been many consultations, and there will continue to be consultation, on the development of policies and the implementation of programs. I have, for example, an appointment this afternoon with one of those groups for the purpose of discussing housing policy in light of the problem of the native people.


Mr. Speaker, I wish to direct a supplementary question to the Prime Minister since the Minister of State has not explained the dismissal of Mr. Rudnicki. In view of the fact the Prime Minister wrote to the Native Council of Canada on February 4, 1973, assuring them that the government and its agencies would listen to the advice of the Native Council on policies and programs intended for them and "further to consult with the native people for whom the programs are designed and indeed to involve them in the implementation of these programs," can the Prime Minister say how this involvement in consultation is to take place when an official, who in good faith proceeded to involve the native people, is dismissed?


Mr. Speaker, the principle of consultation is as I wrote to the Native Council, and as repeated by the minister a moment ago. On the matter of the dismissal, I think the hon. member had better direct her questions to the minister responsible for that general area.


Mr. Speaker, may I direct a final supplementary to the Minister of State for Urban Affairs. What steps has the minister undertaken to ensure that the new housing policy for Metis and non-status Indians will not be endangered by recent events in his department?


Mr. Speaker, I am working with the Native Council, to use the existing new terms of the Housing Act most effectively and am considering and have asked my policy advisers to consider amendments and changes that can make housing policy more responsive to the particular needs of the native people, which are really twofold. First, incomes are extremely low and, second, housing is located in rural and hinterland areas. I hope to be able to produce policies for their consideration very soon.


Mr. Speaker, may I direct a supplementary question to the Prime Minister. Has the Prime Minister consulted with the Minister of State for Urban Affairs about the firing of Mr. Rudnicki? If so, can the Prime Minister inform the House whether the basis for his dismissal was a breach of cabinet secrecy?


No, Mr. Speaker, I cannot recollect that we discussed this matter. I repeat, the question should be addressed directly to the minister rather than skirting around it as the hon. member for Kingston and the Islands has done.


Mr. Speaker, I direct my question to the Minister of State for Urban Affairs. Can the minister inform the House why Mr. Rudnicki was fired from his job?


Mr. Speaker, I want to make it very clear that matters relating to personnel, including appointments, discipline and dismissals, are not the responsibility of the minister but are the responsibility, clearly, of Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation.


Oh, oh!
November 9, 1973


Clearly, the responsibility and control rest with the president of Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation. It was, accordingly, the president who investigated the events that preceded Mr. Rudnicki's dismissal and who came to the conclusion that all the circumstances did in fact require the action that he took in the discharge of his responsibility for the administration of the corporation.


Let's have an investigation.


The person involved has approached me and I asked the president to review the circumstances, which he has done. The president confirms his decision.
I am reluctant to go into details on matters of individual personnel, for two reasons. First, the person involved, as I understand it, is considering, as is his obvious right, legal action. He is also considering employment elsewhere, which I understand informally he has obtained. I do not want to say anything that would prejudice the rights of the parties to any lawsuit or the right of Mr. Rudnicki to further employment.


I have a supplementary question Mr. Speaker. In view of the minister's expression of sympathy for meeting the needs of the native people in the field of housing, why will he permit the president of Central Mortgage and Housing, who has never demonstrated anything except an ability to make money, to fire the one person in Central Mortgage and Housing who had the confidence of the native people?


Mr. Speaker, neither premise of the question is correct.


Mr. Speaker, may I direct a supplementary to the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister say that he will talk to his ministers about inconsistencies in their dealings with their staff, whereby Mr. Rudnicki is fired because of close relationships with the people he is dealing with and Mr. Austin is less detrimentally affected although he has close relationships with the people with whom he deals?


Mr. Speaker, on the first part of the question, I think it should be clear to the House and anyone who is not grossly prejudiced in this matter that the firing was not based on the fact that Mr. Rudnicki knew the Indian people and had good relations with them. He was fired after a series of events which are perfectly well known.


What is the real reason? The Prime Minister knows. This is a cover-up.


Mr. Speaker, may I direct a supplementary question to the Minister of State for Urban Affairs. Does the dismissal of Mr. Rudnicki imply that the government does not accept the policy formulations of the planning unit of CMHC?


Mr. Speaker, the government has not had the opportunity of considering those policy proposals, so I am unable to answer.
Oral Questions


Order, please. There are three or four members seeking supplementaries on this important matter. I will recognize the hon. member for Parry Sound-Muskoka and attempt to complete the first round of questioning, after which we will return to this matter and hear all the supplementaries that hon. members may want to ask.


Mr. Speaker, may I direct another supplementary to the same minister. Will future policy formulations of the planning unit of CMHC be discussed in Cabinet without an opportunity for other discussion?


Mr. Speaker, the policy proposals will be put to my colleagues by me and will be considered by them.


Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Manpower and Immigration. In light of apparent inequities in the allocation of LIP funds to constituencies, would he be prepared to ask the House for a reference to the Standing Committee on Labour, Manpower and Immigration of the matter of the allocation by constituency of funds for LIP projects and the criteria which have been employed in making those allocations, and would he agree to appear before the committee and provide that committee with a list of the allocations made?


Mr. Speaker, I will take note of the representation. I note also that the question of allocations and the criteria is on the order paper, and I will be addressing myself to that. The supplementary estimates of the department will shortly be before a committee, and I certainly anticipate that this question will be dealt with. I will welcome the opportunity to put it on the table before the committee at that time.


Can the minister assure us if he makes an appearance before the Miscellaneous Estimates Committee during consideration of the supplementary estimates of his department, that the figures, constituency by constituency, of the amounts of money and the criteria will be made available to the members of the committee and that his officials will be there to defend their position?


Mr. Speaker, that would be my intention. I point out that the expenditures under last year's Local Initiatives Program were made available in response to a question on the order paper, and that is what I would intend.


Mr. Speaker, may I direct a supplementary to the Minister of Manpower and

November 9, 1973
Oral Questions
Immigration. Since he admitted to the House yesterday that labour force survey figures were an inadequate basis for LIP grants and allocations and told us that, instead, they were based on an accumulation of data at Canada Manpower Centres, and since I have discovered that job applications at these centres bear little or no direct relationship to the various riding allocations and their sizes, would he tell us, when you rule out these two crucial yardsticks, what kind of base figures and statistics were used?


Mr. Speaker, I do not rule out those yardsticks. In fact, I believe that their elaboration is probably much better done in the way the hon. member who asked the preceding question proposed, namely, before the committee. I will be glad to give details there on how the formula is applied.


On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, it would be very difficult for us to do what the minister suggests because we still have neither the figures nor the formula from last year.


I have a supplementary question, Mr. Speaker. Can the minister confirm whether extra funds have been set aside from the public treasury to iron out the inequities in a number of constituencies?


Mr. Speaker, I do not accept the premise of the question about inequities. As to the main substance of the question, no such decision has been taken. If and when it is taken, it will be announced in the normal manner.


Mr. Speaker, I should like to put a question to the Minister of Communications.
Can he say whether, since November 1, the Quebec government has formally asked for a meeting with him to consider the problem of cable television and does the minister intend to revise the federal government position on this?


Mr. Speaker, I have already answered that question following other ones which had been put to me on the same subject. Everything hangs now on the position that the provincial ministers and the federal Department of Com-

munications will take at the conference to be held on November 29 and 30 next.

[ English]


Mr. Speaker, I have a question arising out of the statement made by the Secretary of State for External Affairs. First, how many men are going to be sent from Canada for the peacekeeping force? Second, inasmuch as the No. 1 combat paratroop unit stationed in Edmonton was originally put on the alert, has it been decided that they will not be sent, nor will any actual combat troops be sent as part of the force?


Mr. Speaker, perhaps I might answer the question in the reverse order. It was never the intention that combat troops would be sent. We were asked by the Secretary General on behalf of the Security Council to supply the logistics component. We are not yet certain how many will be involved because, as I said in my opening statement today, the results of the evaluation have not yet been fully assessed. The Secretary General has asked us in the meantime to send one signals unit.


How many men would that be?


We are not quite certain how many that will involve. Perhaps my colleague, the Minister of National Defence, can answer that question better than I.


Mr. Speaker, the core of the Canadian contingent will be supplied by the No. 1 Canadian Signals Regiment from Kingston. Initially, an advance party of 100 will be leaving, but we expect that over the next few days that could build up to over 400 from the signals corps.


The Secretary of State for External Affairs stated it was not intended to send combat troops. Why was it that the No. 1 combat paratroop unit in Edmonton was asked to be on the alert preparatory to being called upon to serve as members of this peacekeeping force?


Mr. Speaker, I have explained to the House before that the No. 1 airborne regiment in Edmonton is trained not only for combat but also for a peacekeeping role. The logistics role is one of very great importance. Communications are important to the success of any military mission, and so is transportation. I think that even armchair generals like the right hon. member and myself should know that much about a military mission.


Certainly the hon. gentleman has identified himself well.


You are an honorary armchair general.
November 9, 1973


Mr. Speaker, I have a supplementary question to the Minister of National Defence. Can the minister assure the House and the country that in making up the logistics requirement for the Canadian group going to the Middle East the helicopter and other air-sea rescue strength of Canada's armed forces at Comox and elsewhere will not be reduced?


Yes, Mr. Speaker. I have given that assurance before, and at the present time there is no requirement for Canadian aircraft.


My question is supplementary to the first line of questioning to the Minister of State for Urban Affairs. Was the minister satisfied with the recommendation of the president of Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation with regard to the firing of Mr. Rudnicki who had 18 years service or did the minister undertake to look into the matter personally before any decision was made to fire Mr. Rudnicki?


Mr. Speaker, the president's action was not a recommendation, it was a decision of which I was informed, of course. With regard to the purpose of the question, do I support the action of the president, the answer is obviously yes.


In view of the answer the minister has just given, is he now prepared to apply the same standards regarding possible conflict of interest to Mr. Teron as he is apparently applying to Mr. Rudnicki?


Hear, hear!


Can the Minister of State for Urban Affairs assure the House he did not know anything about the incident for which Mr. Rudnicki was fired until after he had been fired by the president of CMHC?


Mr. Speaker, the president informed me beforehand, as any good president would do.


In order that the House may be informed as to just what happened, will the minister advise whether there was any discussion between the president of CMHC and himself from the time of the incident to the time of the firing and whether that discussion was by communication, verbal or in writing, direct or indirect?


Mr. Speaker, obviously I communicate with the president of CMHC almost daily about the whole range of activities of the corporation.


Oh, oh!
Oral Questions


That was not the question. A supplementary-


You are covering up something.


Order, please. The hon. member for Vancouver South can ask a supplementary.


Obviously members opposite do not want the truth to come out. My question was quite plain and the minister knows perfectly well what the question was. Was the minister consulted about this firing before it took place?


Mr. Speaker, I just answered that question. I told the House I was informed.


Mr. Speaker, may I direct a question to the Minister of Transport. In view of the concern expressed by the chairman of the Canadian Wheat Board within the past two days that we probably will not be able to meet our commitments because of congestion in the country elevator system and the lack of supplies at Thunder Bay and Vancouver-indeed, Thunder Bay is at an all-time low-what action is being taken to correct this situation? Has the minister been in consultation with the man or the minister in charge of the Wheat Board?


Mr. Speaker, I have not been in consultation with the man in charge of the Wheat Board but with the minister responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board. I know a meeting was held with the railways a few weeks ago. I, personally, have a commitment from CNR and CPR that they will meet their commitment. If they do not, that means I was misled.


In his discussions with CNR and CPR with regard to this problem, did the minister make inquiries with regard to the amount of Canadian rolling stock or boxcars that are in the United States and did he receive any assurance by the railroads that they would try to get some of that rolling stock back into Canada to move Canadian goods?


Mr. Speaker, many weeks and many months before the hon. member put the question in the House, CNR, CPR and the Department of Transport were worrying about this problem. I think that the cars now in the United States do not constitute a real problem. The time within which they are returned has been shortened considerably. The situation is improving. I think each railway has about 11,000 cars for use in the transport of grain and they are sure they can meet their commitment.

Oral Questions


May I ask the Minister of Transport whether any consideration has been given to the purchase by the federal government of additional hopper cars, as was done last year, particularly since the Wheat Board has made such a recommendation and since there is a chronic shortage every year, not necessarily arise because of the strike this year?


I think all those negotiations have been carried on by the minister responsible for the Wheat Board, and it would be preferable to address the question to him when he is here.


I asked the minister a simple question, whether the government was considering the purchase of additional rolling stock as was done last year. It requires a simple answer, yes or no.


And I gave the hon. member a very simple answer, that he should put his question to the Minister of Justice.


Mr. Speaker, my question is directed to the Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce. In view of the fact Canadian manufacturers and distributors of newsprint have refused to supply the weekly newspapers of eastern and other parts of Ontario with newsprint, will the minister guarantee that the government will not grant any export licences or allow the sale of any Canadian-made newsprint to foreign markets until supplies are assured to all Canadian newspapers, weekly or otherwise?


Is that your attitude to oil?


The hon. member's question reflects the serious shortage of newsprint on a world-wide basis. My department has been meeting with publishers who have run into difficulties and with representatives of the industry, and in a number of cases we have been successful in arranging supplies for those who are out of newsprint.


I asked the minister whether his department would guarantee that publishers in Canada will be able to get newsprint before we export newsprint abroad.


There is no intention of placing export controls on newsprint.


Mr. Speaker, I have a question I should like to put to the Prime Minister. Now that the right hon. gentleman has visited both Russia and China, is it his intention very soon to visit the countries of the European Economic Community as the leaders of all other important industrial nations have done in the past few months? If so, does he expect to announce plans for such a visit within the very near future?


I take this to be a representation, for which I warmly thank the hon. member.


As the Prime Minister knows, it is not a representation; it is a question seeking an answer on a very important subject. Now, I will ask him a supplementary. Is the reason for the unaccountable delay on the part of the Prime Minister in arranging such an important visit the fact he has been unable to obtain an invitation from France to visit that country and he is unable to make the trip unless he is first able to obtain such an invitation?


No, Mr. Speaker.


That is not the way I heard it.


Oh, oh!


It is interesting to find once in a while that members on the other side are still alive, even if it is only a matter of making noise.


Mr. Speaker, I should like to direct a question to the Minister of Supply and Services who indicated a few days ago that discussions were going on in connection with the Canadian Commercial Corporation purchasing home heating oil offshore. Can the minister tell the House whether the corporation is, in fact, seeking to purchase home heating oil, how much the corporation has been instructed to purchase and how much it has purchased to date?
[ Translation]


Mr. Speaker, negotiations are continuing between a Toronto dealer and my department, and not the Canadian Commercial Corporation, and we hope to complete today the purchase of approximately 40 million gallons of distilled oil. We expect that the schedule of delivery may be flexible enough to enable us to offset about 10 per cent of the fuel shortage that we anticipate for this winter.
November 9, 1973


Mr. Speaker, I would like to ask a question of the Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce.
Considering the number of layoffs occurring at the Davie Shipbuilding Limited at Lauzon, can the minister inform the House whether new contracts are going to be allocated to this firm to reassure the workers about their future?
If so, what kind of federal assistance will be granted and to whom?


A short while ago I announced the extension of the shipbuilding subsidy program for Canadian shipbuilding. I believe this has been very successful. More than that, the Export Development Corporation has become increasingly active in this field and today it is signing an agreement with the Cunard Steamship Company Limited for the purchase of two 39,000-ton product carriers with a total value of $35 million. The Export Development Corporation will be financing 80 per cent of that purchase.


Hear, hear!


I have a question for the Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources, Mr. Speaker. Is the hon. gentleman actively assessing measures in conjunction with the provinces for the revitalization and revival of the eastern Canadian coal industry as an important supplementary energy source? I noted yesterday that in answer to a question by the hon. member for Cumberland-Colchester North the minister suggested that coal was a provincial resource. I should like to ask him whether there are many resources that are not provincial?


We have discussed this matter with the Nova Scotia authorities. We have indicated to them that any initiative that might be taken with regard to bringing into production again what- have been, historically, high-cost coalfields lies, of course, at the provincial level.


I have a supplementary on the same topic to the Minister of Transport. Bearing in mind the energy crisis and higher fuel costs, is the minister considering a revision of existing subsidy arrangements with carriers across the nation? Further, is he considering the granting of subsidies with respect to the possible supplying to central Canadian markets of eastern and western coal,
Oral Questions
provided he is satisfied that the CNR and CPR are now delivering coal at reasonable rates?


those questions are under study in various departments, including the Department of Transport.


I have a supplementary for the Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources. I would ask the minister whether he is aware that the Cape Breton coalfields are a federal resource and not a provincial one?


The question was asked with regard to the Cumberland County fields.


Mr. Speaker, I should like to address a supplementary to the Minister of Transport arising out of reports that the railways have tabled a schedule of rates for carrying coal from the west to Ontario, which a study carried out by the Ontario government shows to be about 50 per cent higher than they should be. Will the minister take steps to make certain that the information placed before the Canadian Transport Commission by the railways is made public and that the CTC undertakes its own study immediately of the cost of transportation of coal from western to central Canada?


I will surely look into that. The hon. member will, no doubt, recall what I said in the House as far as freight rates are concerned, and I will see if the action taken by the railways conforms to the statement I made. We made a commitment in the west to the effect that the provinces would be informed as to all details of railway rate structures, and I hope that one of the provinces will ask for this information.


On a point of order-


Order, please. There are only a few minutes left before the end of the question period. The hon. member for Central Nova wishes to raise a point of order. I will return to the hon. member for York South, then the hon. member for Bellechasse, and we will try to go on from there.


Mr. Speaker, I will be very brief, and I ask for your guidance in this matter. In view of all the undertakings made in the last few months by the Minister of Transport to look into a whole multitude of matters, I wonder whether there is a provision in the rules for a whole day to be set aside so the minister can make a report on these various issues.


The hon. member for York South.

Oral Questions


Mr. Speaker, I understood from the minister's answer that action to make available the facts upon which the railways are basing their freight rates has to wait until some province asks for the information. I should like to ask the minister whether he will see to it that the CTC undertakes its own study of the basis on which the railways are now trying, if the Ontario study is correct, to make quite unjustified profits out of the rather difficult situation in which Canada finds itself?


Mr. Speaker, I will surely ask for all the pertinent information.

Mr. Speaker, I should like to put a question to the Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources.
Since Quebec Hydro has announced the construction of a second nuclear station and since the first one has been slowing down due to some difficulties in obtaining heavy water, can the minister tell the House if he will soon announce the decision of the government concerning the construction of another heavy water plant?


Mr. Speaker, we have not taken any final decision on that matter, but the announcement will soon be made as mentioned by the hon. member.

[ English]


Mr. Speaker, my question is supplementary to the question asked by the hon. member for Lanark-Renfrew-Carleton. It is addressed to the Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce and is a little complex. In light of the fact that most weekly newspaper operators use letter press and most of those operating in Ontario use offset and require sheeted newsprint, and also in light of the fact that the mills have put all the people engaged on conversion of rolled newsprint and shee
