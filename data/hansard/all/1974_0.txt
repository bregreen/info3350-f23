Mr. Speaker, I rise on a question of privilege to salute this special day, January 11, which, although not a national holiday despite the eloquent representations of my colleague, the hon. member for Hillsborough (Mr. Macquar-rie), deserves very special recognition from members on all sides of this House and, indeed, all Canadians.
January 11 is the birthday of our first Prime Minister, Sir John A. Macdonald-


Hear, hear!


-the
man who gave Canada its first national policy, the man whose vision encompassed a country extending from sea to sea. We do well to remember the extravagantly generous, even profligate, expenditure of his time and talents as a parliamentarian and as a great nationalist in order to see his dream fulfilled.
One of the fascinating things about this day, Mr. Speaker, is that the enduring powers of persuasion of Sir John A. Macdonald are still so great in influencing others to follow the art of politics. It is no mere coincidence, Sir, that in this present House six members share January 11 with Sir John A. as their birth dates: the hon. member for Saint John-Lancaster (Mr. Bell), the hon. member for St. John's East (Mr. McGrath), the hon. member for Lafon-taine (Mr. Lachance), the hon. member for Gander-Twil-lingate (Mr. Lundrigan), the hon. member for Winnipeg South Centre (Mr. McKenzie) and the hon. member for Victoria (Mr. McKinnon). I am sure we all join in wishing them well on this special day.


Hear, hear!


Mr. Speaker, I rise under Standing Order 43 on a matter of urgent and pressing necessity. The urgency arose yesterday with the indication that the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern
Development may not proceed this session with Bill S-4, which has been reported out of committee and which would establish eight new national parks. If the House gives unanimous consent to this motion, we would agree that there should be no debate on the motion or the bill. I therefore move, seconded by the hon. member for Comox-Alberni (Mr. Barnett):
That this House give unanimous consent to proceeding today with all remaining stages of Bill S-4, immediately upon the final disposition of Bill C-236.


Under the terms of Standing Order 43 the hon. member's motion requires unanimous consent. Is there unanimous consent?


Agreed.


No.


There is not unanimity. The motion cannot be put.


Mr. Speaker, I also rise under the provisions of Standing Order 43. In view of the fact that the Hawker Siddeley plant at Trenton, Nova Scotia, intends to close its heavy forging and machining facilities, the largest of their kind in Canada, and the fact that this could do serious harm to the economy of the Maritimes, I move, seconded by the hon. member for Sault Ste. Marie (Mr. Symes):
That this House instruct the Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce, to force Hawker Siddeley to keep the forging and machining facilities in operation.


Is there unanimous consent?


Agreed.


No.


There is not unanimity. The motion cannot be put.

1976 Olympic Games INDIAN AFFAIRS


Mr. Speaker, I rise pursuant to Standing Order 43 on a matter of pressing and urgent necessity in recognition of the situation whereby native people are often at a disadvantage with respect to employment opportunities. Therefore I move, seconded by the hon. member for Kingston and the Islands (Miss MacDonald):
That the Prime Minister discuss with all his ministers having jurisdiction over departments and Crown corporations like Canadian National Railways, Air Canada, Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation, the Canadian Wheat Board, etc., the possibility of giving increasing emphasis to native people for employment opportunities and on the job training programs.


Is there unanimous consent?


Agreed.


No.


There is not unanimous consent. The motion cannot be put.


Mr. Speaker, I rise on a matter of urgent and pressing necessity under the provisions of Standing Order 43. In view of the fact that the Department of Supply and Services has closed its computer offices, giving $4 million annual business to Computel Systems Limited and Systems Dimensions Limited, I move, seconded by the hon. member for Meadow Lake (Mr. Nesdoly):
That all studies related to the decision to move the computer services to the private sector, be sent to the Standing Committee on Transport and Communications and that this committee be instructed to report to the House of Commons on all matters related to the use of such information by the two companies involved.


Is there unanimous consent?


Agreed.


No.


There is not unanimity. The motion carnot be put.

Mr. Speaker, I rise under the provisions of Standing Order 43

on a matter of urgent and pressing necessity having to do with further recent statements that the contract for television coverage of the 1976 Summer Olympics was not put out to tender and that apparently part of the financing of this coverage involves an alleged gain by the Quebec Liberal Party. I therefore move, seconded by the hon. member for St. Paul's (Mr. Atkey):
That all further federal co-operation with COJO be suspended until a public inquiry is held into the letting of a TV contract to the ABC network and allegations of political gains and exclusion of other legitimate bidders are investigated.


The House has heard the motion of the hon. member. According to the provisions of Standing Order 43, this motion requires unanimous consent. Is there unanimity?


Yes.


No.


There is not unanimous consent; therefore, the motion cannot be put.

Mr. Speaker, I rise under the provisions of Standing Order 43 on a matter of urgent and pressing necessity. In view of continuing problems concerning the administration of St. Anne's Hospital at Fort Smith in the Northwest Territories and in view of dissatisfaction with the curious manner in which the Commissioner of the Northwest Territories is handling the current investigation, matters which have been raised continuously by the local newspaper, The Pilot, I move, seconded by the hon. member for Comox-Alberni (Mr. Barnett):
That the minister responsible for the administration of health services in the Northwest Territories order an immediate and thorough inquiry aimed at making the facts of the case available to the public and at solving the problems which have led to a lack of confidence in the health services available at Fort Smith.


The motion is proposed under Standing Order 43. Is there unanimous consent?


Agreed.


No.


There is not unanimity.

Mr. Speaker, I rise under the provisions of Standing Order 43 on a matter of
January 11, 1974

urgent concern to all Canadians. In view of the fact that though an oil pipeline from Sarnia to Montreal could be completed by an earlier date than a pipeline following an all-Canadian route, but would be able to supply only one-quarter of the needs of eastern Canada, I move, seconded by the hon. member for Timiskaming (Mr. Peters):
That this House recommend that if the Sarnia pipeline extension is built, the government also undertake to build an all-Canadian route so that self-sufficiency and security of oil supply may be assured.


Is there unanimous consent?


Agreed.


No.


There is not unanimous consent.


Mr. Speaker, I had in mind seeking consent at this point to move an adjournment motion which might make it possible for the House to adjourn later today subject to the possibility of Royal Assent later and return late in February. Because of one or two uncertain elements in the picture I am unable to put the adjournment motion at this stage. Therefore, having had conversations with representatives of other parties, I am hopeful I might get the consent needed to revert to motions later today if the circumstances are propitious in order to move such a motion.


Mr. Speaker, we showed our initiative in cooperation yesterday and we shall be pleased to co-operate today along the lines suggested.


We agree with the request for consent to revert to motions later today to deal with this matter.


Is it agreed and so ordered?


Agreed.


for leave to introduce Bill C-250, to amend the Veterans Land Act.


Explain.


Mr. Speaker, the purpose of this bill is to amend the Veterans Land Act to protect the rights of spouses to file any claims under either provincial law or provincial statute that they may have for dower rights or
Thanksgiving Day
otherwise. At the present time, since land under the Veterans Land Act is registered in the name of the director of the Veterans Land Act, no claims can be filed in most provinces, thereby depriving spouses of rights that they normally have.


Motion agreed to, bill read the first time and ordered to be printed.
for leave to introduce Bill C-251, to amend the Criminal Code.


Explain.


Mr. Speaker, this bill is designed to remove the unfortunate confusion that has arisen in respect of section 45 of the Criminal Code, which it has been suggested may be used as a defence to charges under section 251, namely the abortion provisions of the Criminal Code. This bill is designed to remove section 45 as an available defence to any charge under section 251.


Motion agreed to, bill read the first time and ordered to be printed.
for leave to introduce Bill C-252, to amend the Canadian Bill of Rights.


Explain.


Mr. Speaker, the first right that we have under the Canadian Bill of Rights is the right of the individual to life. Unfortunately there has been some suggestion that "individual" does not necessarily include the individual who is unborn, and in some situations those who are either sick or the elderly. This bill is designed to define the word "individual" so that this word will be taken to mean all human beings, including unborn human beings, those "en ventre sa mere" and the aged.


Motion agreed to, bill read the first time and ordered to be printed.
for leave to introduce Bill C-253, respecting the proclamation for Thanksgiving Day.

January 11, 1974
Veterans Land Act


Explain.


Mr. Speaker, as our Thanksgiving proclamation now has been in use for 16 years, this bill seeks to require each year a new Thanksgiving proclamation to be issued by the government of Canada and read by His Excellency the Governor General of Canada.
It has been the traditional practice for the identical proclamation to be published annually and, because it is out of date, it frequently fails to acknowledge relevant and current benefits that have accrued to Canadians during the preceding year.


Motion agreed to, bill read the first time and ordered to be printed.
Mr. Speaker, I ask leave to adjourn the House pursuant to Standing Order 26 for the purpose of discussing a specific and important matter requiring urgent consideration, namely, the proposed phasing out of the Veterans Land Act by March 31, 1974, which will result in deying to over 100,000 veterans benefits available to them under the act, instead of increasing the maximum loan ceiling and reducing the lot requirements.


Hear, hear!


As required by the rules, the hon. member for Humber-St. George's-St. Barbe has given notice of his intention to propose the adjournment of the House under the terms of Standing Order 26. The subject proposed for discussion by the hon. member relates to the phasing out of the Veterans Land Act by March 31, 1974.
It is hardly necessary to remind hon. members that the decision of the Chair under the Standing Order is strictly procedural and is not related to the importance of the matter or to the concern it may evoke among hon. members. The terms of the Standing Order and well established practice confirm that a number of requirements must be met before the business scheduled for consideration by the House on a specific day can be set aside. The subject proposed for discussion must be a new one in the nature of an emergency. In this particular instance it is relevant to note that the problem has been raised on a number of occasions over a long period of time by a number of members, and more particularly by the hon. member for Humber-St. George's-St. Barbe.
The Standing Order also requires the Chair to take into account the possibility that the matter might be discussed on other occasions, or that there may be other opportunities for debate. As hon. members know, all of the seven

days in the current supply period, which expires on March 31, are available now or would be available during March after a possible adjournment or prorogation. In addition, I think it is reasonable for the Chair to assume that other and additional opportunities for debate will be available in the month of March or before.
In view of the circumstances, the Chair has to rule that the proposed debate cannot take place today under the terms of Standing Order 26.


Mr. Speaker, I have a question for the right hon. Prime Minister. Does the government have any plans to help the Canadian who has managed to save a few thousand dollars and has perhaps invested it in insurance or Canada savings bonds, who now has no way at all to protect himself against inflation and who last year, for example, saw the value of the real purchasing power of his savings decrease by nearly 10 per cent? Has the government any plans to encourage such Canadians to continue to try to save a little money?


In this particular case, Mr. Speaker, I have no plans to announce.


Having regard to those Canadians, and there are hundreds of thousands of them, who have perhaps put a little money into Canada savings bonds at an interest rate of about 7 per cent and have seen the real value of their savings decrease by nearly 9 per cent last year, does the Prime Minister regard it as part of the just society that, in addition, the government also taxes the income such a Canadian receives from that investment in spite of the fact he has actually lost 10 per cent during the course of the year?


The just society is something toward which we must strive every day, and I would be happy to receive any constructive suggestions from the Leader of the Opposition.


Resign!


Oh, oh!


A new government would help.


Mr. Speaker, yesterday the Prime Minister expressed concern that an incomes policy is hard on the little man and easy for the rich man to get around.


Order, please. I assume the Leader of the Opposition will be asking a question. I do not think we should become involved in debate at this stage.


Mr. Speaker, my question is this: Is it the position of the Prime Minister and his government that it is preferable to follow policies which make life practically impossible for the unorganized worker and destroy the savings of the little man who is trying to save some money, while creating thousands of new millionaires who are able to take advantage of the situation.


No, Mr. Speaker.


Mr. Speaker, I want to ask the Prime Minister a question regarding the special communications branch in the National Research Council to which reference was made yesterday and I think the day before. Has the government given consideration to the propriety of a middle power like Canada being involved in intercepting and decoding foreign information not so much for its own use but for the use of one of the super powers? Is such an activity of value to Canada's own interests or does it merely underline Canada's satellite position in international affairs?


Mr. Speaker, the government has assessed from time to time its activities in this general area, and I say "general" because I am not agreeing with the facts as stated by the hon. gentleman. We have assessed it from time to time and we have decided to continue any security and intelligence activities which are of benefit to Canada and to discontinue any which might be of benefit merely to a foreign power.


Mr. Speaker, in view of the fact the National Research Council obviously is not the appropriate agency for such an operation and that consequently the president and the council are made responsible for a division about which they probably know nothing and over which they have no control, may I ask the Prime Minister whether the government would consider taking this operation out of the National Research Council and placing it in a more appropriate department such as the RCMP or National Defence or under the super-spy, the Secretary of State for External Affairs?


Mr. Speaker, I am not prepared to confirm the existence of the operations the hon. member has mentioned in his allegations, but I am happy to take note that he says there are some areas of government where spying operations should be conducted and I will consider his suggestions.


I have a final supplementary, Mr. Speaker, because I do believe that these matters are of importance to this country. I want to ask the Prime Minister the following question. In view of the fact Canada has a normal avenue of co-operation with the United States and other countries, such as the co-operation between the RCMP and the FBI in the United States, between the
Oral Questions
Department of State and embassies in Washington and between the Department of External Affairs and embassies in Ottawa, may I ask the Prime Minister whether the time has not come for the Canadian authorities to cease to have anything to do with the CIA in the United States which has been involved in some of the most discreditable actions across the world?


Mr. Speaker, the RCMP, when it deals with its opposite numbers in other countries, is not making a judgment on the policies of the governments which our government has judged to be friendly and allied. The CIA is the organization set up by the responsible government in the United States. If my hon. friend has some representations to make against them, I would gladly convey them through the proper channels if he wants to transmit them to me.


Mr. Speaker, I wish to ask a question of the Minister of Manpower and Immigration.
In view of the numerous applications for unemployment insurance which are withheld in the Quebec City regional office because the notices of termination of employment have supposedly not been received yet, can the minister give the House guaranties that he will have an inquiry made in the Quebec office, because checks with recipients have revealed that two, three, or even four notices have been addressed to the office? Will the minister inquire and tell the House what decision he intends to take concerning this problem?


Mr. Speaker, I will certainly inquire. If the hon. member has details regarding the particular firms or locations involved, they would be of help to me. I must say, however, that the responsibility for producing the necessary evidence, which includes indication of severance, is a fundamental requirement for entitlement under the act, and that responsibility lies with the employer and the claimant, although we will do everything we can to help expedite it.


Mr. Speaker, I wonder if the minister is aware or has received notice of the objection by the Toronto Transit Commission which seeks some relief from the increase in unemployment insurance premiums as the cost to the commission will be approximately $1 million in 1974, some $450,000 more than in 1973? Has he received such a statement of concern and, if so, what has been his reply?

Privilege-Mr. Diefenbaker


Mr. Speaker, such a specific communication has not crossed my desk. I certainly have seen allusions to this in the press but I have not personally received directly such a representation.


In light of the fact that when I asked the minister the other day whether he was seeking to bring in legislation that would increase the minimum qualifying period he indicated to me that he was not looking at the act in isolation, can the minister now advise the House whether in fact he is looking at the act in its entirety in order to make sure that legislation is referred to in the Speech from the Throne? Is this the minister's intention?


I do not think I can elaborate with value on the comment I made on that very subject in my statement to the House on November 7,1 believe, when I said that we were examining the policy and the legislation in light of the full year's information with all the data available.


Mr. Speaker, I should like to point out to the Prime Minister at once that I share his general view in connection with security and realize how very easy it is for anyone to conjure up weaknesses in security because the subject cannot be discussed openly and in parliament. For that reason I ask him whether or not the government will give consideration to a course that has been followed in the United Kingdom of setting up a royal commission, headed by the Chief Justice of Canada, I would suggest, to look into the whole question of security to the end that Canadians will learn that our security is well placed or, if not, about its weaknesses, and above all so it will show that we are indeed not a satellite of any other country?


Mr. Speaker, if the right hon. gentleman will permit me to refresh his memory, we had a Royal Commission on Security which entered its report a few years ago, I believe three and a half or four years ago. We have implemented many of the recommendations of that report, although not all of them. Indeed, one of them was that we should have a security branch which would be entirely civilian and separate from the RCMP, but because of our lasting confidence and respect for the RCMP we decided to have the security and intelligence branch remain under the general authority of the commissioner. Incidentally, that is why the Solicitor General has been able to refute the unfounded allegation of the right hon. gentleman about the Crown disappearing from the uniform, an allegation which I would like the right hon. gentleman to retract.


Hear, hear!


Oh, oh!


Mr. Speaker, I would not have been able, except with the assistance of the Prime Minister, to

rise on a question of privilege, and I thank him for the opportunity he has provided to me by that gratuitous statement.
May I say at once that the Solicitor General alleged with much pride-he is now being joined by the Prime Minister who apparently has been converted to the RCMP after what he did to destroy them a year and a half ago-that a crown has now been produced that otherwise would not have been and we have one more crown. Let me point out that this crown, a part of the emblem of the RCMP, is now being placed on a tieclip and will be totally invisible to anyone; it is a miniature emblem. The statement I made was entirely well-founded and the explanation by the Solicitor General outside the House was one that will not hold water in any way. The crown-


Order, please.


On the same question of privilege-


Order, please. I think I have to remind the right hon. gentleman that he has risen on a question of privilege, but it seems to me more a question of debate.


No.


If he has a question of privilege, perhaps he should indicate to the Chair in what way it is privilege so that I may make a ruling.


Simply the fact that a minister outside the House went as far as he could toward falsifying the facts and pretending that the crown had been added when all that was done was that a picayune tieholder or clasp with the actual emblem of the RCMP has been added.


On the same question of privilege, Mr. Speaker, I do have a question of privilege because the integrity of one of my ministers has been brought into question.


Not integrity.


Oh, oh!


And Lang's.


There will be one great shuffle this year.


The right hon. gentleman has made an allegation based, as he said, on a document or a circular to the effect that the crown was being removed from the uniform and now is trying to hide that allegation by diverting attention to the fact that not only was it not removed but one was added that he finds it too small. I think the right hon. gentleman, if he were not being merely mischievous in inventing these calumnies about the minister, should have the honour and decency to apologize to the House.


Hear, hear!


Oh, oh!
January 11, 1974


Resign!
[DOT] (U40)


Order, please.


Mr. Speaker, on a question of privilege-


Order, please. I will recognize the right hon. gentleman, who rises on a question of privilege, but I would seek the co-operation of hon. members, including right hon. members, so that we might get on with the question period as we are quickly running out of time.


Mr. Speaker, I rise again on a question of privilege. The Prime Minister mentioned, in his reply to me a moment ago, that apparently my memory was at fault. I at no time forgot two years of my life-


Oh, oh!


-and I recall-


Order, please. The right hon. gentleman has risen on a question of privilege. I assume it is a new question of privilege. The right hon. gentleman rose in the first instance on a question of privilege and at some length indicated what the question was. The right hon. Prime Minister replied to the question, as was his right. Now the right hon. member for Prince Albert seeks the floor on another question of privilege. I would hope we could bring this matter to some conclusion.


Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister has referred to the RCMP and the attitude of the government. I remind him of the fact that-


What about the crown?


Yes.


The Prime Minister keeps on interrupting. I remind him that he will not qualify for the description that is generally used of him, "PET", so far as I am concerned.


Order, please. I would hope the right hon. gentleman would try to assist the House and the Chair, if he has a question of privilege, by indicating what that question is because we do have to try to make headway.


Mr. Speaker, I always follow that course, but when there are petty interruptions from the Prime Minister I will answer them. He speaks of the RCMP. Has he forgotten that, when I said a year and a half ago that "RCMP" was being removed from detachment buildings and vehicles, he said outside the House that it was not true, but when 30,000 people in western Canada pointed out that they had seen it then he came around to the explanation that people did not know what RCMP meant.


Order, please. What this additional statement has to do with privilege is beyond my comprehension.


Hear, hear!
Oral Questions


Oh, oh!


The hon. member for Winnipeg North Centre.


Mr. Speaker, on a question of privilege-


I apologize to the hon. member for Winnipeg North Centre, but the minister rises on a question of privilege.


Mr. Speaker, the right hon. gentleman from Prince Albert has just accused me of making false statements outside the House and, I believe, inside the House. I want to say that in the House he insinuated that by RCMP administrative bulletins Nos. 54 and 78 some change was being made in the RCMP insignia by taking away the crown from the RCMP uniform. I pointed out inside the House and outside the House that bulletin No. 54 did not deal with the uniform, crest or crown but with postal codes, and that bulletin No. 78 dealt with some minor changes in the uniform such as a lighter summer shirt and wider tie. The only reference to the crown or crest of the RCMP was that we were now adding the RCMP crest to the tieclip. In fact, that there was no removal but an addition of the crown, even though a small one.


Hear, hear!


Now that all these important and far-reaching questions of privilege have been debated and settled, the Chair will now call on the hon. member for Winnipeg North Centre.


Mr. Speaker, may I direct a question to the right hon. the Prime Minister. In view of the fact that a member of the Prime Minister's staff who works in the field of press relations is now the vice-president and general manager of the consulting firm which has been hired to make the press arrangements for the forthcoming first ministers' conference, and in view of the fact that even though this person plans to leave the Prime Minister's office some time in February he is at the moment in a dual capacity, may I ask the Prime Minister what he intends to do about this obvious conflict of interest?


Mr. Speaker, the first thing I intend to do is to say that the hon. gentleman is repeating allegations which are completely false and unfounded. Mr. Chapman is not vicepresident and general manager of any such firm, and I regret that the hon. gentleman in his question alleged such things as facts. Mr. Chapman has no connection with that firm. He has indicated to me that he intends to resign from my office at the end of the month and thereafter take some position in that company.


Oh, oh!

January 11, 1974
Oral Questions


That is the fact.


Some free advertising.


Mr. Speaker, I think this is the proper way of proceeding. Had Mr. Chapman not warned me in advance I would think there might be some questions from over there, but he has told me he is going to seek separation from my office and go to work in other fields. I think this is perfectly honourable conduct, and I would like to know what is reprehensible about it.


Hear, hear!


Mr. Speaker, if I quoted something from the press which turns out to be inaccurate, that, of course, can be corrected. But I ask the Prime Minister if it is not a fact that in his discussion about conflict of interest he has himself called for full disclosure, and will he arrange for a full disclosure on the part of Mr. Chapman of any interest he now has, pecuniary, or otherwise, in the consulting firm that has been given this contract?


Mr. Speaker, the hon. gentleman missed my answer. I indicated that Mr. Chapman had precisely made that disclosure to me. He told me he had no connection whatsoever. He had been in discussion with these people. He indicated to me that there was an interesting future for him there and that he intended to resign from my office at the end of the month and seek employment there.


The Chair will recognize the hon. member for Winnipeg North Centre for a second supplementary, after which I will see the hon. member for Egmont.


As a last supplementary question, Mr. Speaker, may I ask the Prime Minister if it is not true that Mr. Chapman's having a job agreed to and arranged for is in fact a connection with that firm?


Mr. Speaker, my question is directed to the Minister of Regional Economic Expansion. In view of the fact that the Atlantic region, one of the designated regions under the minister's department for special development assistance, is being hurt increasingly by growing unemployment and rising costs, particularly related to energy, an important component in industrial development, has the minister consulted with the premiers and the ministers of industry in the Atlantic provinces about the reduction, as of the end of 1973, of capital costs from 35 per cent to 25 per cent, and of direct job provisions from $7,000 to $5,000, with the view that some appropriate increase must take place to offset rising costs in particular?


Mr. Speaker, I have had conversations, both in a general way and in a specific way, on the energy question with the appropriate minister, at least in the province of Newfoundland. The figures the hon. member quoted are, of course, the maximum figures. They do not necessarily reflect what has been given in the past. I have asked our incentive people, in terms of working out a new formula for incentives under the Regional Development Incentives Act, first of all to see what changes might be desirable in terms of these levels and also to take the cost of energy in production into account in determining the level of grants we might give. In other words, while the ceiling was 30 per cent or 35 per cent in some instances, it very rarely reached that figure so that I do not believe the reduction will have a significant effect on the actual level of grants made.


Can the minister indicate whether there has been any lessening in terms of industrial activity and expansion in the region, or whether there has been any specific request from provincial governments with regard to the restoration of this ceiling in order that there will not be an increasing disadvantage for industrial development in the Atlantic region?


Mr. Speaker, on the specific question, the answer is no. I might point out to the hon. member that 25 per cent was, of course, the ceiling until such time as Montreal and the Montreal area were designated for a very limited period. At that time the Atlantic provinces representatives suggested they would prefer to be with the 25 per cent and have Montreal dedesignated, so when we dedesignated Montreal this automatically brought it back to the former level. There is no representation in that regard at the moment, but there are a number of conversations going on with all four Atlantic provinces with regard to specific and major undertakings. I might say, with your indulgence, Mr. Speaker, that one of the questions I discussed only recently is the whole question of the lower Churchill Falls development and the utilization of that energy particularly in the province of Newfoundland.


Order, please. Practically all the members on my left have risen. There are about ten minutes before the end of the question period. I will recognize the hon. member for Dartmouth-Halifax East, if he will be patient, in a moment, but I remind hon. members that there are just ten minutes before the end of the question period and it is difficult to expect that all members who rose a moment ago can be recognized.


Mr. Speaker, my supplementary question is for the Minister of Regional Economic Expansion. Inasmuch as enabling legislation with regard to MAGI, the Metropolitan Area Growth Incentives Corporation for the metropolitan area of Halifax and Dartmouth, was passed by the House in September, 1972, and inasmuch as we have yet to have a
January 11, 1974

chairman and vice-chairman appointed and a functioning office established, is the minister now prepared to tell the people of Atlantic Canada, particularly the people of the metropolitan area, when we may expect this long overdue appointment, delayed by inexcusable political consideration, to be made so that we have a chairman?


Mr. Speaker, the position, as I have indicated on a number of occasions, is that this appointment must be made jointly by agreement with the province of Nova Scotia. The federal government has made to the government of Nova Scotia a number of proposals, one, most specifically, with regard to an appointee who was satisfactory to the Department of Regional Economic Expansion. This particular nominee was not acceptable to the government of Nova Scotia. I have communicated with the premier of Nova Scotia. I am anxious to have this officer appointed post-haste, and I hope the premier will give us his suggestions in the very near future.


Mr. Speaker, I should like to ask a question of the hon. Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce.
Since the large companies that use cast iron for their production offer higher prices to Quebec foundries in order to obtain supplies required, which is to the disadvantage of small businesses, has the minister received representations on this subject from Quebec industries and, if so, what action is he planning to take to obtain a better distribution of this precious alloy?


Mr. Speaker, if I understood the hon. gentleman's question, it had to do with the use of scrap metal in Canada. There have been considerable discussions on the part of the government with dealers and users of scrap in an effort to overcome the scarcity of supply brought on by the United States' imposition of controls on the export of scrap metal to Canada.


Mr. Speaker, I should like to put another question to the Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce. I think he misunderstood the words I used. I was not talking about scrap but about cast iron. This alloy is used by Quebec foundries to produce parts for small businesses. Since large companies also use cast iron for their products, they are offering higher prices to guarantee their supplies. I have received complaints about this. This is why it-


Order, please. Will the hon. member allow the minister to reply to his question? Time is short.
Oral Questions


Mr. Speaker, there appears to be a problem with regard to the definition of foundry feed stock. I will be pleased to meet the hon. member after the question period and go into the matter with him.


Mr. Speaker, may I direct my question to the Minister of State for Urban Affairs. In view of the finding of a coroner's jury dealing with a death in Rochdale College that the manager is frightened to evict certain people from Rochdale College because there are drug addicts and drug peddlers, would the minister now take action to clean up this mess in Toronto?


Mr. Speaker, I have taken as vigorous action as the law allows. As the hon. member knows, the federal government, or CMHC, does not have possession, nor is it entitled to possession of the building. As a result of our foreclosure action, we are awaiting the decision of the trial court in Ontario, which I hope will award us possession. In that case we, as the possessor of the building, will act as vigorously as possible to protect both the public interest and the lives and safety of the people in the building.


Mr. Speaker, this is a very important question. Clarkson and Gordon are, I assume, the administrators of this bankrupt enterprise on which thousands of dollars of the taxpayers' money have been spent. I ask the minister, who answers for CMHC, if he will not take action now to evict and remove these drug peddlers and drug users who are a cancer on society in that particular area?


Mr. Speaker, I should make it clear, and I thought the hon. member as a lawyer would understand the situation better than he apparently does, that Clarkson and Gordon are in possession of the building and are managing it by order of the court of Ontario on behalf of all creditors. They are not receivers on behalf of CMHC.


But they became the administrators with the consent of the minister, Mr. Speaker.


Mr. Speaker, my question is to the Prime Minister. Can the Prime Minister advise the House as to what discussions he has had with COJO, the Montreal Olympic Organizing Committee, if any, regarding the letting of the television contract to the American Broadcasting Company for $25

million, without tender, to cover the Montreal Olympic games when the National Broadcasting Company had in fact indicated that they were prepared to bid up to $32.9 million, without any strings attached?


I have had no discussions of that kind, Mr. Speaker.


I wonder whether the Prime Minister knows that Carl Lindeman, Vice-President of the Columbia Broadcasting System, in addition to not being given a chance to bid for the contract was told point blank that he would have to kick in $5 million to the Quebec government for pay-offs if he wished to negotiate a contract with COJO, and that he refused to do business with Canada along those lines? Will the Prime Minister advise the House whether he is willing to take immediate steps to initiate an inquiry into the many and constant allegations arising from the ABC contract with COJO, inasmuch as the contract was finalized without giving the other networks an opportunity to bid for the coverage of the Montreal Olympic games?


Order, please.


Mr. Speaker, it is not the policy of my government to look into the dealings and decisions of a provincial government in matters within its jurisdiction. If I understand it to be the policy of the Conservative party that I should suggest such a course to Premier Bourassa, I will do so, but I would want to know if the hon. member is speaking on behalf of his party.


Oh, oh!


Mr. Speaker, on a point of order-


Order, please. I appreciate that the Leader of the Opposition wants to rise on a point of order. He will be recognized in a moment. I remind hon. members that we should try to limit supplementaries as much as possible.


Mr. Speaker, I rise simply because the Prime Minister has made a statement that is very misleading. The hon. member's question related to the responsibility of this government with regard to a project being supported by this government. The Prime Minister tried to twist this around in an attempt to indicate that we want to interfere, somehow improperly, in provincial affairs. Is the Prime Minister prepared to exercise his responsibility to look into a matter that clearly involves the responsibility of this government?


Hear, hear!


Mr. Speaker, the extent of the involvement of this government was made quite clear to the House of Commons in a statement by me in the House in January of last year. I spelled out that involvement. I indicated to the House we would not support the Olympic project at all if it did not have the support of the House of Commons. The support of the House of Commons was given, including that of the Conservative party. We are living up to every undertaking the government undertook

to discharge in every aspect as regards COJO and the Olympic project, but we have not undertaken to monitor the relations between COJO and the provincial government any more than we have decided to monitor the relations between the federal Conservative party and the Toronto government in its dealings.


Hear, hear!


Oh, oh!


Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Regional Economic Expansion who is responsible for the Cape Breton Development Corporation. It is related to an earlier question I posed to the minister on December 10. On that occasion, I raised the question of an increase in the allowances received by preretired coal miners in Cape Breton. At that time the minister replied that Devco would have the government's complete approval if the corporation were to increase the allowances now received in accordance with the actual cost of living. What steps has the minister taken since that time to bring this about, and how soon will the expressed approval of the government be implemented? Also, does the minister have knowledge of what steps the corporation has taken or is taking to implement the government's complete approval of this action?


Mr. Speaker, without being precise as to dates and without checking the record, my recollection is that, in terms of the last submission by Devco of their capital budget and the various changes which were made in the preretirement plan, pensions and so on, it was agreed at that time that pensions would be escalated on the same basis as the Canada Pension Plan. Without checking the dates, I cannot be sure that has actually happened in terms of the Canada Pension Plan or when it happened, but the two are now in concert. One will go up at the same rate as the other. The increase will be on the same basis as the Canada Pension Plan.


Mr. Speaker, my question is directed to the Prime Minister. It refers to the previous series. In view of reports that costs for coverage of the 1976 Montreal Olympics by the CBC, which will act as host broadcaster, may soar well beyond the $25 million federal commitment articulated by the Prime Minister on February 2, 1973, has there been any further commitment
January 11, 1974

by the government of Canada to cover these added costs or will they be borne by the province of Quebec or the CBC?


No, Mr. Speaker, there has been no further commitment by the government. I see the Secretary of State, who answers for the CBC, indicating that my statement is correct. It will, of course, be important for the CBC to make sure it does not go beyond the authorization of parliament, an authorization which was given by most members of the House.


As it is alleged that the non-tendered $25 million contract between ABC and COJO involved a $5 million under the table deal with the Quebec Liberal party, is the government of Canada investigating this allegation-that is all it is at the moment-with a view, if it is confirmed, to lessening the government of Canada's contribution for Olympic broadcasting coverage by an equal amount?


Mr. Speaker, the question is hypothetical in its form. However, I hope this matter will be drawn to the attention of the government of the province of Quebec and that it will be able to refute these facts for all to hear.


Order, please. Hon. members will appreciate we have just about reached or gone beyond the time allocated to the question period. I was hoping we could have two or three more questioners, but if we get involved in points of order we might as well go on with government business. The hon. member for Fraser Valley West rises on a point of order.


Mr. Speaker, my point of order has to do with the reply just made by the Prime Minister. I would like to ask him how one can refute facts.


Mr. Speaker, I stand corrected. I obviously should have said the alleged facts.


Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Veterans Affairs. In view of the mounting protests, representations and resolutions being received by the minister's office from veterans' organizations and veterans, has the minister had consultation with the veterans organizations of Canada who want to extend the March 31 deadline under the Veterans Land Act? Will he indicate what consultations he is having and what his reaction is?


Mr. Speaker, I first wish to tell the hon. member
Oral Questions
that as far as the Veterans Land Act is concerned there has been considerable discussion and talk. In 1962, parliament passed an act which stated the cessation date would be March 31, 1974. Also, previous to that, eligibility for building certificates was to be in the hands of veterans by 1968. This was done quite some time ago. I think the hon. member is very familiar with the government that did that. At that time there were other plans available to veterans. Those other plans were re-establishment credits and university training. They were phased out. I also want to say we are certainly looking at this again. We want to keep faith with the veterans who did apply.
I remind the hon. member it is 30 years since the end of world war II and 20 years since the end of the Korean war. This has not been rapidly brought upon the veterans. At the same time, we are taking a close look at it. If I have sufficient information to make me think this date should be changed, I will so recommend to the government. However, it is something that has been in process for a long period of time. We have to assess the facts. We have to keep faith with those for whom this program was designed and they in some cases have to keep faith with us.


In view of the co-operation of the minister, will the government House leader direct a reference to the Standing Committee on Veterans Affairs so that we can call the veterans' organizations to express the feelings of hundreds of thousands of veterans on the phasing out of this act?


Mr. Speaker, I will be happy to consider that. I will consult with the Minister of Veterans Affairs. I have the feeling we might as well stay if we want to continue the work of parliament at this time by continuing committee work. However, I will consider the proposal.


Mr. Speaker, I have on two occasions requested the Minister of Transport to investigate the announced freight rate increases affecting western Canada. Can the minister tell us today what action he is contemplating to prevent these increases and require the two major railway companies to honour the commitment made by the minister during the Western Economic Opportunities Conference that freight rates would not be increased for 18 months until a study had been carried out? Can the minister give us an answer today? The House is adjourning and we would like to know.


Mr. Speaker, I have honoured my commitment. I think it is wrong to state in the House that I have not done so. The rates which were frozen were normal and competitive rates, not negotiated rates. I think the commitment has

been complied with by the railways. If the hon. member has other representations to make, that is another matter.


Mr. Speaker, my question is to the Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources. The minister informed me last week that he would find out whether the results of the reexamination of the Fundy tidal power report would be available before the meeting of first ministers takes place. Is the minister now able to tell us when this report will be available?


My understanding is that the studies which were commissioned by the joint federal-provincial commission will be available by the end of the month, and I hope to be able to report to the hon. member as soon as the commission can report to me concerning its conclusions.


Mr. Speaker, my question is also directed to the Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources. Is the minister in a position to answer the question which was raised on Tuesday of this week by the hon. member for Yukon, and tell us whether arrangements have yet been made to permit representation of the northern territories at the federal-provincial energy conference later this month?


As I indicated earlier, since this is to be a meeting of first ministers the arrangements are being made by an agency of government other than my own department. My understanding is that arrangements have not yet been completed with regard to this matter but perhaps my colleague, the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, could comment on the specific question of representation of the territories.


This question is being looked into. I can assure the hon. member that the Northwest Territories and the Yukon will be adequately represented at the conference.


May I ask a supplementary question which was not answered directly by the Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources when I put it to him the other day? It has to do with the policy of the government of Canada with respect to treating the Yuko
