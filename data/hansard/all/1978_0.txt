Mr. Speaker, under the provisions of Standing Order 43, I rise on a matter of urgent and pressing necessity to move, seconded by the hon. member for Vegreville (Mr. Mazankowksi):
That this House feels, having regard to the recent developments in Africa, the time is overdue to advise the government of Cuba that with an army of 110,000 men, of which some estimated 23,000, under the direction and with the co-ordination of the Soviet Union, are engaged in action in Africa and in particular in Angola where diabolical cruelties were perpetrated against its people by this army, and in a so-called liberation movement designed to drive out democratic governments Cuba has troops now in Mozambique, Malagasy, Tanzania, the Congo Republic, Sierra Leone, Guinea, Liberia and Algeria, in Rhodesia they are engaged in arousing revolution, and elsewhere assisting in the drive of African guerrillas against white minorities: in consequence of this, the peace of the world is endangered, and this House declares, despite the closeness of the relationship and mutual admiration between president Fidel Castro and the Prime Minister of Canada that-


No.


Even on this happy day I suppose there will be mutual messages. My motion continues:
-a warning in the form of an ultimatum be given to Fidel Castro that either he have his troops returned from Africa and agrees to desist from stirring up war and revolution, this House not only condemns what he is doing, but if he does not desist and return the troops to Cuba, Canada will have to consider terminating the large financial aid that she is providing to Cuba-


Order.


Order, please. This is a very long motion. I hope the right hon. member is coming to the end of it.


Mr. Speaker, the assistance of hon. gentlemen opposite makes it impossible to be brief. My motion continues:
-and also give consideration to ending diplomatic relations.


Oh, oh!


Presentation of such a motion for debate, pursuant to Standing Order 43, requires the unanimous consent of the House. Is there unanimous consent?


Agreed.


No.


Mr. Speaker, I would like to move a motion under Standing Order 43. In view of the irresponsible statements by the Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce in Hamilton yesterday, where reportedly he indicated that he is not concerned about the devaluation of the Canadian dollar and, furthermore, that the dropping of the Canadian dollar to as low as 80 cents U.S. would be a good thing for Canada-


I never said that.


What did you say?


-I move, seconded by the hon. member for Winnipeg North Centre (Mr. Knowles):
That this House condemns the minister's irresponsible statements, talking down the Canadian dollar, which only encourages speculation and uncertainty and lack of any confidence in our currency.


Is there unanimous consent for the presentation of such a motion?


Agreed.


No.


Mr. Speaker, under the provisions of Standing Order 43, I ask for the unanimous consent of the House to introduce a motion dealing with a matter of pressing necessity.
In view of the numerous requests made by the National Council of Veterans' Associations in recent months concerning the increase in the basic rate of disability pensions for veterans; in view of the fact that there is a $240 annual income

April 6, 1978
disparity between the average wages of unskilled civil servants and the disability pension of veterans; considering also that the federal government must ensure that a fair pension is paid to disabled veterans and to the widows whose spouses willingly courted danger and sacrificed their lives, I move, seconded by the hon. member for Bellechasse (Mr. Lambert):
That the House direct the Minister of Veterans Affairs (Mr. MacDonald) to take all necessary steps in the shortest possible time to introduce a bill aimed at increasing the basic rate of disability pensions for veterans and thus correct inequities existing between the latter and the wages of the unskilled workers comprising five groups of civil servants now on the labour market.


The House has heard the motion of the hon. member. Under the provisions of Standing Order 43, this motion requires the unanimous consent of the House. Is there such consent?


Agreed.


No.


Mr. Speaker, pursuant to Standing Order 43,1 seek the unanimous consent of the House to move a motion on a matter of urgent necessity and great national interest.
Considering that the Minister of State for Federal-Provincial Relations (Mr. Lalonde) openly recognizes that the referendum bill he has introduced was prepared and drafted without previous consultation with the provincial governments; considering that, when the first ministers met last February, the federal government formally proclaimed its intention always to consult the provincial governments on all matters of national interest; and considering that nothing could more directly involve national interest than a bill providing for a referendum or amendments to the constitution, I move, seconded by the hon. member for Brome-Missisquoi (Mr. Grafftey):
That the House unanimously decide to postpone consideration of the referendum bill until all provincial governments have clearly indicated their position on this issue, for hon. members need to know where the provinces stand before opening an intelligent debate on such a vital issue.


The House has heard the hon. member's motion. Pursuant to Standing Order 43, this motion requires the unanimous consent of the House. Is there unanimous consent?


Agreed.


No.
[Mr. Allard.)


Mr. Speaker, under the provisions of Standing Order 43, I ask for the unanimous consent of the House to introduce a motion dealing with a matter of urgent and pressing necessity.
Considering that eastern Canada's potato growers are going through the worst selling campaign in 25 years because of artificially low prices; considering that yesterday the federal government announced initial and part payments of about $60 million to western grain producers; and considering that eastern Canadians are not less deserving that western Canadians as regards monetary needs to pay for seeds and to compensate for the loss of net income, I move, seconded by the hon. member for Ottawa-Vanier (Mr. Gauthier):
That the Minister of Agriculture (Mr. Whelan) and the Agricultural Stabilization Board immediately announce the payment formula or formulas for potato growers.


Order. Under the terms of Standing Order 43, presentation of such a motion requires the unanimous consent of the House. Is there unanimous consent?


Agreed.


No.


Mr. Speaker, my initial question is for the Prime Minister, who undoubtedly is very anxious to tell the House when the budget will be presented. In telling the House when the budget may be received, can he tell Canadians why the budgetary deficit, which was approximately $20 for every Canadian when he took power, rose to almost $500 for every man, woman and child in the country in the year just ended?


Mr.Speaker, it seems to me that the answer to the question-


Hear, hear!


Mr. Speaker, I thank hon. members on both sides of the House for their very warm applause.


Hear, hear!
April 6, 1978


Jack Horner didn't applaud.


I certainly cannot guarantee that they will all be here in ten years to wish me another ten years.


Hear, hear!


There may be, in those days, a couple of leftovers, including myself, from a previous depression, Mr. Speaker, but not many more.


Oh, oh!


Which depression?


Mr. Speaker, that is my point. But that is a bit too subtle for the hon. member to understand.
Mr. Speaker, the question is obviously one which is related to the budget debate. The opposition have been asking for a budget debate, and I am glad to see that they are not only welcoming it now, but are entering into it at this point, by their questions. I would suggest they wait until next week, when the Minister of Finance will be making his budget speech, and then maybe we will hear the answer to the point made by the hon. member opposite.


What day?


What day is it, Mr. Chretien?


Mr. Speaker, it will be Monday night at eight o'clock.


Hear, hear!


Mr. Speaker, my supplementary is to the Prime Minister, who surprised me when he did not seem to know the date when the budget debate was to be held. I would also add, with reference to his "depression" reference, that certainly we on this side will not be contributing, as he is, to the next depression in this country.
Mr. Speaker, could the Prime Minister indicate why he feels that during his ten years in office the number of unemployed in this country should have risen from 375,000, when he took power, to over one million Canadians looking for work today.


Mr. Speaker, I think you will agree that the question is argumentative.


Mr. Speaker, again my supplementary is to the Prime Minister, who surely does not feel that Statistics Canada's hard, cold figures which I have just cited are argumentative.


Hear, hear!


Let me ask him this second supplementary, Mr. Speaker. Could he explain to the House and account to the Canadian public why inflation, which was running slightly above 4 per cent when he took power, should now be 9.5 per cent, which is the last figure published by Statistics Canada?
Oral Questions


I am sure the hon. member will realize that if the Prime Minister wanted to attempt to do that, the question period would not provide ample time.


Mr. Speaker, a question for the Prime Minister. I was one of the deluded Canadians who ten years ago voted for the Prime Minister to become leader. I have since atoned for that.


Oh, oh!


My question to the Prime Minister is this: Canada's financial deficit on current account was $97 million in 1968, and was 44 times that last year-$4.2 billion. This is reflected, of course, in the way the world is now dealing with the Canadian dollar: you need a snorkel mask now to deal with the Canadian dollar, which is supposed to be floating.
My question to the Prime Minister is this: Could he explain the reasons for this dismal record and tell us how, in the few days left to him in office, he is going to do something to reverse this tragic decline in our trade balance?


Mr. Speaker, of course we are very anxious to make comments on these statistics and help the Canadian public understand how they should be interpreted, rather than listening to the biased interpretation from the other side of the House.
When a statistic is quoted, I am not saying the statistic itself is argumentative; I am saying the way in which the question is asked is argumentative. Obviously, with respect to each one of these statistics-the one asked now and the previous one by the hon. member for York-Simcoe-we have answers and are anxious to put them forth in the budget debate. For instance, when the hon. member says that the number of unemployed has gone up by something like 400,000 in ten years-


600,000.


-600,000, it would be important for the Canadian public to understand that during that period Canada created jobs at a faster rate than any other industrialized society.


Hear, hear!


You are a fraud.


Mr. Speaker, 2,300,000 jobs have been created in that period in this economy. That, obviously, is an argumentative answer and that is why I am suggesting that this line of question would be properly put during the debate. We are very anxious-


You don't like this kind of question.

April 6, 1978
Oral Questions


Not at all, Mr. Speaker. If the hon. member wants me to give argumentative answers, I will make my budget speech right now. He can just continue asking the questions. On the other question that he asked me-


Mr. Speaker, I suggest if the Prime Minister cannot do better than that, he should give the boots to Coutts.


Hear, hear!


I suggest to the Prime Minister that the electorate of Canada will want the answer in a few months. In 1977, our deficit in fully manufactured end products-that is, the products that give the jobs-was $11.6 billion. If we manufactured those goods in Canada-in reverse-it would mean 800,000 jobs. Can the Prime Minister tell us how he plans to overcome this deficit which has grown from $3.1 billion in 1968 to the present $11.6 billion? What are his plans to reverse that in the next few weeks, before the Canadian people reverse him?


Mr. Speaker, I can indicate at some length that the size of the deficit in Canada now, compared to gross national product, is considerably less than it has been historically in Canada. That should put that matter in perspective.
The hon. member is interested in making puns on personalities. I wonder if he would explain to us why he comes down here to give us advice on economics, when the Premier of Newfoundland did not even think he was good enough to correct the economy in that province.


Hear, hear!


Mr. Speaker, 1 should like to ask a question of the right hon. Prime Minister. Could the Prime Minister indicate to this House whether the statement made yesterday in Hamilton by the Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce, when talking down the Canadian dollar, reflects government policy? When the minister said that he is not concerned about the devaluation of the Canadian dollar, and that the dropping of the Canadian dollar to as low as 80 cents U.S. would be a good thing for Canada-


I never said that.


You did.


Were you there?


Oh, oh!


Order please. The hon. member for Waterloo-Cambridge.


Mr. Speaker, I really wish the backbenchers would keep their ministers in order.


How would you do it?


Jack, if it is not too much of a crossing, come over and I will show you.


Hear, hear!


Mr. Speaker, on some days it is very difficult to get a serious question in.


If the hon. member would put his question, the matter would be complete.


Mr. Speaker, would the Prime Minister indicate whether the Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce was reflecting government policy when he said it would be a good thing if the Canadian dollar dropped to 80 cents U.S.?


I never said that.


Mr. Speaker, the policy of the government, as stated by the Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce, the Minister of Finance, myself and all ministers, is that the dollar should be allowed to find its natural level.


Oh, oh!


It is a floating dollar. I understand hon. members opposite would like to engage in a bit of speculation; they would like us to tell them the way it will float. If they want to risk some money, they can do it on their own.


Hear, hear!


The position of the Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce has been exactly that: it should find its level. He has twice said to the hon. member-and the hon. member understood him-that he did not say the words he was quoted as having said. I would have thought the hon. member would accept that denial as the word of the minister.


Mr. Speaker, I have a supplementary question for the Prime Minister. Of course I am prepared to accept the denial of the minister that he said it; nevertheless, whatever he said has certainly given an impression of what he meant to convey. If he is not guilty of that, he is guilty of having some very loose lips.
An. hon. Member: "Loose Lips Horner".


Let's have a statement, "Loose Lips".


Order, please. I really wonder how much of this kind of preamble we should have. Will the hon. member please put his supplementary question.


Mr. Speaker, this question is to the Prime Minister. In light of the Minister of Finance's fine moral fervour of yesterday when he lectured the opposition to avoid

-would he lecture the Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce along the same lines?
[ Translation]


Mr. Speaker, my question is directed to the right hon. Prime Minister. On this tenth anniversary, Mr. Speaker-


Hear, hear!


Allow me to point out that there are probably a million or more Canadians who do not feel like applauding the way my hon. friends opposite do. In 1968, Canada had
375.000	unemployed; ten years later, we have over a million. Under the circumstances, having failed to find the solutions required, would the Prime Minister have at least the courage to recognize the monumental failure of his government in that regard?


Mr. Speaker, once again it is a matter of quoting statistics with arguments. I repeat what I said a while ago in reply to the same question in English. We would like to hold a debate on budgetary matters; that is why the Minister of Finance announced a budget for this coming Monday night. I can understand that hon. members across the way should want a budget when none is on the way, but now that one is, they do not want a debate because they know we have answers to all those questions. The hon. member speaks of an increase of some 600,000 unemployed; but that should be placed in the context of a Canada in which
2.400.000	new jobs were created over the same period. All those things must be seen in context and that is why we want to have a debate on the budget next week. I trust the hon. member will come forth with his speeches at that time, and that he will listen to the answers we give.


On a supplementary, Mr. Speaker. In answer to that the Prime Minister says they still managed to create two million new jobs. How then can one explain the lack of foresight of the government with regard to the new workers entering the labour market? The Prime Minister tells us they created two million new jobs in the last ten years: how then can that increase of 700,000 unemployed be explained? Under the circumstances, how does one explain the fact that the Prime Minister-

Mr. Speaker, my question is directed to the Minister of Agriculture. It relates to lack of government performance. In view of the fact that farm debt has doubled, to $10 billion, in less than ten years and farmers, under this government, have to borrow simply to survive, what immediate action, if any, can the producers of this country expect to help overcome these serious difficulties?


Mr. Speaker, the hon. member wants to be a little more factual. He knows that land values for farmers have increased about 120 per cent in the past four years. That is a capital gain for the farmers, so naturally they are going to have more investment. But they are much wealthier because of that. There are many farmers in agricultural endeavours who are making net profits; the hon. member knows that very well.


Farm input costs have increased 100 per cent in less than ten years, net farm income has declined 30 per cent in three years, and agricultural imports have tripled since 1968. Without the sale of western grain, total agricultural exports would be nil. What legislation, if any, can we expect to effectively deal with these serious problems?


Mr. Speaker, the hon. member knows very well that we increased our exports last year by 11 per cent on the world market. The hon. member makes broad, sweeping statements about agricultural products that we are importing. He should be more specific and outline what they are. He knows that the Tariff Board report is in, and that action has been taken on imported products.
If we were to swing in and immediately move to stop all the imported tomatoes coming into Canada, the producers could produce them but we could not process them, the facilities are not there. It would have to be a three year phase-in program. The hon. member knows those programs are in the government's machinery at the present time, and that the horticultural producers of this nation recently made an award to this minister for doing more for them than in living memory of the Canadian Horticultural Society.


Order, please.


Mr. Speaker, I have a question for the Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce. We were told yesterday that Renault-Canada is leaving the

April 6, 1978
Oral Questions
province of Quebec and that from now on its complex, located in Brampton, Ontario, will serve only as a distribution centre for Canada. An agreement to build Renault models in the United States has been reached between the Regie nationale des usines Renault of France and the American Motors Corporation. Taking into account the glaring laissez-faire and irresponsibility of the Quebec government on this question and taking into account the loss of jobs that this move will mean for Canada, and particularly Quebec, can the minister tell us if his officials or himself have taken action in the matter?

Hon. Jack H. Horner (Minister of Industry, Trade and
Commerce): Mr. Speaker, I will take this question as notice, owing to the delicate nature of the implications of the Quebec government and the Canadian government in the various automotive plants.


Mr. Speaker, I would like to know if the minister had heard about this move and if he had made plans to prevent it?


Mr. Speaker, I was aware of the possibility of the move. As I said, owing to the delicate nature of it, I would like to examine all the ramifications before answering fully.


Mr. Speaker, now that the Minister of Finance has announced that the budget is going to be presented Monday night, will the Prime Minister, as head of the government, confirm whether it is the intention of the government to have a full length budget debate? If so, will he participate in that debate? Should he participate, would he tell us how he can explain the floating Canadian dollar, and why it should not be known as the "fuddle-buck"?


Mr. Speaker, I thought the first part of the question was a serious one, but it was obviously intended in jest. I am not quite sure what kind of answer the hon. member wants. On the one hand, they wanted a budget debate. When we announced the budget they said "We don't want a budget because it is going to be an election budget."


Oh, oh!


That is what members opposite have been saying.


You are the one who said that.


I never said that.


The absent Leader of the Progressive Conservative Party and the Leader of the NDP-


He is out getting his hair cut.


He may be getting out of shape; I am not quite sure what he is doing. On the other hand, they want us to have an early election. Now they want a guarantee that we are going to take all the time for a full budget debate. If they will make up their minds, I will have the government House leader meet the House leaders of the other parties to see how much business we can complete in the next few days, or weeks-


Oh, oh!


Keep trying; you will screw it up.


Obviously, we are ready for an election any time.


Hear, hear!


We were told repeatedly by the opposition that they wanted to have a budget debate before an election; they challenged us to do it. Our attitude now is that we are going to have a budget debate before an election. We would like to pass other important legislation before an election and we hope we will have the co-operation of the opposition: for instance, the bill to amend the Criminal Code-


Order, please.


Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Agriculture. In view of the fact that eastern farmers have as high and as urgent a cash requirement as do western farmers just before spring seeding, can the Minister of Agriculture now indicate what payments he or the Farm Products Price Stabilization Board intend to make, and when will they be made to eastern potato growers, since the last press release was of little consolation to them?


Mr. Speaker, the hon. member knows full well what the stabilization act is that we use for potato growers. The act used for western grain producers is a voluntary program which they join and contribute to if they wish. Their operation is on a calendar year basis. As I said in the House yesterday, the final figures are not in for that; we do not know what the final figures will be. We will not be changing our historic approach toward the stabilization of potatoes. Potatoes are completely different from cereal grain. Potatoes are a perishable product, while cereal grain can be stored for years. I do not think you can make a similar comparison at all.
April 6, 1978


Mr. Speaker, my question is directed to the Minister of Fisheries and the Environment.
Is the minister prepared to release today the text of the agreement reached recently by the United States and Canada on the question of maritime frontiers?


Mr. Speaker, 1 wonder if the hon. member could be mistaken. Canada has recently reached an agreement with Japan, but not with the United States; that agreement is to the effect that negotiations will resume within a certain period of time, probably in six or eight months from now.


Mr. Speaker, I would like to ask a supplementary question.
Would the minister state, even in very broad terms, the provisions of the agreement between Canada and the United States on the matter of the four sectors involved and could he also explain what criteria were followed in the negotiations with the United States?


Mr. Speaker, I am sure I would need a lot more time than Your Honour would give me to answer in detail the question of the hon. member. As I have already stated, there has not been any agreement. We have agreed that the special negotiators would take some time off in an attempt to identify points where agreements could be reached and to find a solution. Meanwhile, we will have to conclude an interim arrangement for 1978.


Mr. Speaker, I have a question for the Minister of Justice of which I gave him notice yesterday. It arises from a question I put to the minister a few weeks ago concerning the drafting by one, D. Maurais, of his department of an act to establish an inflation monitoring agency and to provide for the reporting of financial and other information. At that time the minister said he would inquire who the officer was, who authorized the drafting of this legislation and the distribution of the draft bill throughout the country.
Oral Questions


Mr. Speaker, I apologize to the hon. member. He told me yesterday that he wanted to ask this question and I undertook to get the information, but because I have been in cabinet all morning I do not have that information. I will get it immediately and supply it to the hon. member.


Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development. Has the minister followed developments in the unequal dispute between the St. Mary's Indian band of Cran-brook, B.C., and the CPR in which the band has threatened to charge the railway with trespass? Can the minister report any progress on this problem of seven years' standing, which deals with erosion into the St. Mary's River from the railway line?


No, Mr. Speaker, I have not followed the developments recently. But I would be pleased to review the matter and report to the hon. member.


Considering the difficulty experienced in negotiating disputes involving Indian bands in south central British Columbia, the delicacy of questions of ownership, the possibility of differences between individual rights and band rights regarding the-we hope-early settlement of the cut-off lands question, and that the nearest Indian Affairs office is as far away as Vancouver, is the minister in a position to announce the reopening of the Indian Affairs office at Vernon, B.C.?


No, I am not, Mr. Speaker.


Mr. Speaker, my question is addressed to the Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce. As the minister knows, there has been a drop in employment in the Halifax shipyards from roughly 1,300 or 1,400 down to 100, and the province has been trying to negotiate the sale of the shipyards by Hawker Siddeley to Upper Canada Shipping Limited. I think the minister has been engaged in the negotiations. Can he report to the House any progress as far as the negotiations are concerned? Many people in that area are suffering as a result of the high rate of unemployment.


Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is quite correct; Hawker Siddeley does want to sell the Halifax shipbuilding

Oral Questions
yards. We are attempting to facilitate new ownership of the yards, but as yet we have not put together a package that is satisfactory to any prospective buyer. I would hate to speculate any more on the matter for fear of upsetting the delicate balance of negotiations at this time.


Mr. Speaker, does the Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce think the lay-offs at the Halifax shipyards are due to workers' inappreciativeness for the retention of their jobs?


Order, please. The hon. member for Palliser.


Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Agriculture. In his statement yesterday relative to grain stabilization payments, why did the minister, in effect, return to the farmers only what had been paid into the funds to date by those very same farmers? Why did the government not make a contribution of its own to match what the farmers had contributed? Could it be that the Minister of Finance wanted to postpone this so that his deficit would not look so bad at the present time?


Mr. Speaker, if the hon. member reads the questions and answers of yesterday, he will find the answer to his question. We still have to wait for cost of production figures from Statistics Canada, and they will not be ready until July.


Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of State (Environment). In the period of time between when the minister receives the final report of the environmental impact panel which is making a recommendation regarding the Eldorado refinery at Port Granby, and the time that report is considered by the cabinet, will there be an opportunity for independent groups and persons to make representations to the government and to the ministers concerned?


Mr. Speaker, I do not know how many groups I will be able to see, but I did tell a group from Port Hope that I would be very happy to see its members before I make a decision on the report submitted to me.


Mr. Speaker, I am sure the minister appreciates that a number of people will want to make representations based on the final report before the cabinet, and especially the

Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources, make certain decisions which may flow out of that report. Will people have an opportunity to make representations between the time the report is released to the public and the time the cabinet finally makes its decision? Will there be an opportunity for interested groups or individuals to make representations to the cabinet or to the ministers concerned?


Yes, Mr. Speaker, I expect to be as flexible as possible. However, wide-ranging public hearings were held by the panel and I hope not to carry on the process for too long.


Mr. Speaker, I am assuming that the minister has not yet received the final report. I wonder if he has any idea when it will be coming, whether he will be releasing it or whether the panel will be releasing it.


Mr. Speaker, 1 expect to receive the report about the middle of April, and I will be releasing it.


Mr. Speaker, my question is directed to the Minister of Public Works. The minister has defined a public works policy whereby all plans for capital projects have to use the metric system. Do even those plans drawn to the standard measure have to undergo metrication before contracts for capital projects are put out to tender?


I do not believe so, Mr. Speaker, but I will be happy to verify that for the hon. member.


Mr. Speaker, I have a supplementary question for the Minister of Agriculture. In view of evidence given by the minister's officials yesterday in the Standing Committee on Agriculture that the long outstanding capital project in the Annapolis Valley, the research station at Kentville, Nova Scotia, is now ten months behind due to metrication of plans already drawn, could the minister exercise his good offices and the weight of his office with the Minister of Public Works and finally announce this project, so that the tenders which have been delayed three times may be dealt with in the early spring rather than some time in June?
April 6, 1978


Mr. Speaker, the hon. member can rest assured that I will do everything I can to help him-out!


Oh, oh!


Mr. Speaker, I would like to direct my question to the Postmaster General. The minister is certainly aware of the deteriorating service provided by his department. Today is a day for statistics and for looking back ten years. I presume the minister is aware that ten years ago-


Order, please. There have been several questions on this theme which, by their very nature, are argumentative. If the hon. member has a question for the Postmaster General, would he put it forthwith.


I would like to ask if something is going to be done to reverse the present trend in the Post Office. Ten years ago there was a $67 million deficit; now there is a $650 million deficit ahead of us. Ten years ago we paid 5 cents for a stamp for first-class mail, and now we pay 14 cents: that is nearly a 300 per cent increase.


Mr. Speaker, referring only to the question of postal rates, I must say that even with a 14 cents stamp our rate remains the lowest in the world. So I do not believe that there has been so much inflation or, if you like, that the increase was scandalous.
I think it is a reasonable rate in the circumstances.


Mr. Speaker, I have a question for the Minister of Consumer and Corporate Affairs. Some two years ago the then chairperson of the Food Prices Review Board had a special study conducted with respect to food prices above the sixtieth parallel in the two northern territories. That report recommended a further study in order to see that food prices be reduced.
In view of statistics released yesterday, indicating that food prices in Whitehorse and in Yellowknife are some 25 per cent above the national average, can the minister now say when that study will be resumed and, if not, has he any plans at all for reducing food prices in the two northern territories?
Oral Questions


Mr. Speaker, I still have as great an interest in the question of food prices in the north as 1 did when I was minister in that department. Just two weeks ago I sent two officials from the Department of Consumer and Corporate Affairs to the north to discuss this very matter. I am afraid I do not have exact information on when this particular study will be proceeded with, but I will inquire into that and get back to the hon. member.


Is the government taking any action whatsoever to bring down food prices in the north-which I emphasize are some 25 per cent above the national average-in Whitehorse and Yellowknife, to say nothing of the more remote communities along the coastal areas of the Northwest Territories?


Mr. Speaker, I would agree with the hon. member that those statistics are alarming. I will bring myself up to date on the work that is being done in this respect.


Mr. Speaker, my question is for the President of the Treasury Board. Due to the great number of representations made to members of parliament, in particular in the Ottawa area, concerning Bill C-28-


Oh, oh!


Be quiet. More especially with regard to sections dealing with the right of the employer to assign not only duties through position but duties to employees, is the President of the Treasury Board in a position today to tell us if he intends to amend this section or to withdraw it altogether?


Mr. Speaker, it was not the intention of the government to permit the employer to make such assignment and/or change of duties of employees, as has been the interpretation of the wording of that clause. We believe that the concerns are unwarranted. However, for absolute certainty, I assure the House that when we proceed with the bill before parliament, we will make the necessary amendment or, if necessary, delete that clause.

Mr. Speaker, 1 should like to ask the Minister of Justice a question. Today I received a news release from the office of the Minister of Justice in which the following statement is made:
The ombudsman will also be able to hear complaints from members of the public about specific actions of the RCMP. The need for a mechanism allowing the public to have complaints against the national police force reviewed by an independent body-
My question is twofold. First, will the minister move immediately on this legislation, and has he ascertained the cost with reference to the priority? We already have a deficit. Second, does he consider-I know the minister is not running again, and I make nothing of that, but that means he will not be Minister of Justice-that it is necessary for the ombudsman to check the RCMP?


Yes.


Mr. Speaker, first,
I think it is essential that we have an ombudsman within the federal jurisdiction. As to whether we will proceed with the bill, the Prime Minister endeavoured a short while ago to indicate to the opposition bills, such as the language of trials bill and others, for which we hope to get the co-operation of the official opposition with regard to passage.


Two days' debate?


With regard to the other part of the hon. member's question, Judge Marin in his report on the RCMP made two recommendations: first, that there be an independent process for the examination of citizens' complaints regarding the force and, second, that there be a different system dealing with complaints and disciplinary matters by members of the force. The bill that was introduced dealing with the ombudsman acts on the first of the recommendations, and the Solicitor General is proceeding with the preparation and introduction of a bill covering the second of those recommendations.


In light of the fact that I have always had confidence in members of parliament when it comes to the

routine of their daily work with reference tc taking care of complaints from their constituents, and even people living elsewhere, I would like to ask the Minister of Justice whether he has ascertained the cost of setting up a new organization within the government, thus adding to the deficit? What is the cost of this new empire which the minister wants to build before he leaves the distinguished position he now holds?


The report upon which the bill is based outlined the projected cost. I think the cost will be considerably lower than that projected in the report.


How much?


The estimate of the cost for the first fiscal year, if the bill is passed this session, is $700,000 for the start-up, appointment and establishment of the capacity to deal with some 200 complaints per month. It is, of course, impossible to determine with any certitude what the business of the ombudsman will be. It is also very dependent upon the style of the ombudsman one appoints. The Quebec ombudsman deals with 7,000 complaints a year, with a staff of some 30 people. The Ontario ombudsman deals with 6,000 complaints a year, with a staff of about 140 people. We hope to appoint the Quebec-style ombudsman as a more effective and efficient way of dealing with the matter.


Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Postmaster General. On March 20 one of the stores in Vancouver mailed an advertising brochure to the poeple of Surrey, which was delivered on March 28, for a sale to be held on March 27. Can the Postmaster General collaborate with the Minister of State for Small Business to see if they can find ways to help small businesses stay in business in the face of the kind of perverse help they are getting from the Post Office?


Mr. Speaker, I believe we are making every necessary effort to have the most efficient mail service possible. Accidents or errors may happen, and I think that in this case it was an error and 1 am very sorry it happened.


Mr. Speaker, may I ask the Postmaster General a question? Since several hundred thousand Canadians cannot have their mail delivered, will the minister now make the decision to spend some or all of the last postal rate increase on installing postal walks in cities in Canada with new suburban areas? Over 2,000 postal walks

are needed. Would he agree now to establish these new mail deliveries for Canadians across the country?


Mr. Speaker, if I did what the hon. member is asking for, it would mean spending millions of dollars. Considering the fact that the opposition is always telling us we are spending too much money, the increase in the postal rate was imposed so as to decrease to S525 million the deficit which was projected to be $717 million and I think it was a wise move. If we expanded door to door delivery, it could cost many hundred million dollars, because all across Canada people want it at the moment. But at the present time we must be reasonable and we must try to administer the Post Office like good businessmen.


Mr. Speaker, I have a question for the Prime Minister. There was an exchange between the Prime Minister and the hon. member for Edmonton West with respect to the budget debate and 1 will be asking the government House leader when we might be commencing the debate. But no answer was given by the Prime Minister on whether the budget debate will be shortened or there will be a full debate. I ask the Prime Minister, as leader of the government, what is the intention of the government with respect to the length of the debate? Are we to have the full six days' budget debate, or is the government's intention otherwise?


We could go either way. If the opposition has a preference, I would appreciate hearing from them what it is.


Quite frankly, my preference is to go to the country, beat this dreadful government and get it over with.


Order, please.


I do not believe that has anything to do with the length of the budget debate; at least, I did not think it would. But if it does, would the Prime Minister tell the House whether or not we will have a full debate? It is a simple question and I would like as direct an answer as I gave him.


Mr. Speaker, we are attempting to be extremely accommodating in this matter. At the request of the opposition, we made sure we would have a budget before dissolution. We have announced that budget. They seem to grumble that there is going to be a pre-election budget. I am not quite sure what they have in mind. Now I am saying, Mr. Speaker, if they want quick dissolution after we read the
Business of the House
budget speech, we can go that way-if that is what they would like. If they are completely indifferent, my suggestion to them is, why don't they wait and see?


Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the act of accommodation of the Prime Minister, but still I would like an answer to my question. What is the intention of the government?


Mr. Speaker, if it is a very serious debate, and if the opposition comes forth with very constructive proposals, we will want to hear them through to the bitter end. If they are making politics out of this, we might just dissolve before.


Hear, hear!


Oh, oh!


Third report of the Standing Committee on Transport and Communications in both official languages-Mr. Collenette.
Third report of the Standing Joint Committee on Regulations and Other Statutory Instruments-Mr. Baldwin.
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Before the government House leader has to leave the House, in the event he does, and since the budget date has been announced today, I wonder if 1 could ask a question with respect to that in the course of the usual Thursday question on House business.
I think the House would be interested in knowing on what day after April 10 the budget debate will be commencing. Once the budget debate has commenced, is it the intention of the government to carry it through on six consecutive days to the normal end? Or is it the intention of the government to break up the budget debate and deal with other legislation in the meantime? If the government House leader can be any more forthcoming than the Prime Minister (Mr. Trudeau), I know the country would be grateful. That is one question I should like to put to him.

Business of the House
My second concern is that there is a motion for concurrence in the report of the Standing Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs dealing with that committee's report on pornography. I understand it may well be the intention of the government House leader to call that business. If it is his intention to call it, I want to assure him that we are prepared to have that motion concurred in without debate.
The third thing I should like to deal with is that it is important, and obviously it is becoming much more important from the point of view of the answers of the Prime Minister today, for him to give us an indication of the government's priorities with respect to legislation as we go into the next week. I would appreciate it very much if the government House leader could be as straightforward as possible with respect to those questions.


Mr. Speaker, it is my present intention in calling the budget debate on Wednesday to provide hon. members with an opportunity to savour the flavour of the budget address. It is my intention to call the budget debate and continue it in the regular sequence, in accordance with the Standing Orders and all constitutional opportunities which may present themselves. Nothing will be done that is not fully regular.


Oh, oh!


At the present time I have no intention of interrupting the budget debate with other legislation. It may be that will happen, but it is not my intention.
In addition to the budget debate, today I will call the amendments to the Anti-Inflation Act, then the Farm Credit Act, followed by the bill in the name of the hon. Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources (Mr. Gillespie), petroleum administration act amendments and then Bill C-8, the labour code. I want to talk to my colleagues in the other parties on whether we might agree to pass, within a very short time, the act to amend the Criminal Code with respect to the language of trials. I should like to get that passed quickly, if we can get consent from hon. members to deal with it quickly.


Mr. Speaker, my friend's answer speaks volumes to all of us. He mentioned Bill C-18. I understand there may be anxiety on the part of the Minister of Agriculture (Mr. Whelan) to deal rather quickly with the Farm Credit Act. That is a matter he and I may wish to discuss. I would be happy to discuss it on the basis that I believe debate on that will be quite short.


Mr. Speaker, with respect to this point of order, may I say first of all that someone should be commended for the new clocks in the chamber today. The times may be out of joint in Canada, but it is good to have the clocks in this place synchronized.
May I remind the government House leader that on at least two occasions, once when Mr. King was prime minister and once when Mr. St. Laurent was in that position-both of them Liberals-the House was informed a few days ahead of disso-

lution as to the actual date of the election so that we could plan the work of the last week or ten days with some sort of sense. I wonder if the government House leader would discuss with the Prime Minister (Mr. Trudeau) the possibility of following that precedent, and straightforwardly telling us what the election date is so that we can decide what should be dealt with in the intervening time.


Yes, Mr. Speaker, there are a lot of members of this side, as well as the other side, who would be interested in knowing that date. As always, I will attempt to co-operate with hon. members opposite. It would be very important information to them, from which they would likely be ready to clear the order paper in a very short time.


Will the government House leader be calling an early meeting of House leaders so that we can discuss the plans for the remainder of this session?


Yes, Mr. Speaker.


On the same point of order, Mr. Speaker, this is a very important matter, a very serious one, of interest not only to members of parliament but indeed to taxpayers. We have repeatedly suggested that the election date should be provided for in the constitution, that it be established once and for all and known to every Canadian. I feel that such an amendment would provide a very clear-cut rule for holding general elections, avoiding a lot of dealings and so many public opinion pools of no use whatsoever.
Therefore, Mr. Speaker, I would like to support the point made by the leaders of other parties in this House, that we be apprised as soon as possible of the date of the coming election. Mr. Speaker, I believe this would facilitate our proceedings, we could go ahead in an objective way with the process of dealing with government bills that have a high priority. Simultaneously, as far as the budget is concerned, after the answer given today by the right hon. Prime Minister (Mr. Trudeau) that the budget hopefully will be coming Monday next, this would allow members to seriously address the question of what should be discussed about the forthcoming budget, in the interest of Canadians we are trying our best to serve here. In this way we could work together at giving Canada the best possible administration, the most efficient one, so that the Canadian tax dollar be put to the best use, for the benefit of all groups within our society.


Mr. Speaker, I would like to put a question to the government House leader. I noticed when he listed the order of business that he mentioned the lifting of the antiinflation legislation, then the farm credit legislation, the petroleum administration measure, and then Bill C-8. I would
