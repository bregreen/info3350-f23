I am sure hon. members are aware that a number of successful candidates in the recent by-elections will be introduced into the House today in the usual manner. I cannot believe there could be anything more important for the House to turn its attention to; therefore, we ought to proceed to that as a matter of priority.
I will, of course, respect the time which is usually set aside for the question period and I ask for the co-operation of hon. members if they have applications pursuant to Standing Order 43. I ask them to exercise some discretion in that regard. Obviously, we ought to call those motions. If they are absolutely essential in nature, we will take them; but if certain matters can wait another day, I ask for the co-operation of hon. members because I expect it will take some minutes to introduce the new members.

Mr. Speaker, pursuant to Standing Order 43, I ask for the unanimous consent of the House to present a motion on a very urgent matter, namely eligibility for unemployment insurance.
Considering that clause 57 of the regulations derived from the Unemployment Insurance Act reads as follows, and 1 quote:
The employment of a person in agriculture, horticulture, forestry and harvesting by an employer who
(a)	pays the employee a remuneration that is less than two hundred and fifty
dollars in cash in a year, or
(b)	employs the employee for a period of less than twenty-five working days in
a year is excepted from insurable employment.
Considering that such a rule is detrimental to the farmer who has difficulty finding labour and discriminatory to the agricultural worker who does not enjoy the same status as the industrial worker; considering that because of this unfair piece of regulation hundreds of fruit and vegetable pickers in Quebec who worked in Ontario will be deprived of unemployment insurance benefits, I move, seconded by the hon. member for Bellechasse (Mr. Lambert):
That the Minister of National Revenue (Mr. Guay) lose no time in having clause 57 of the regulation removed so that all workers in Canada are put on an equal footing and are dealt with in a fair manner.


The House has heard the motion of the hon. member pursuant to Standing Order 43, such a motion requires the unanimous consent of the House. Is there unanimous consent?


Agreed.


No.


Mr. Speaker, I rise, under the provisions of Standing Order 43, on a matter of urgent and pressing necessity. I refer to the fact that the acting president of CUPW in St. John's, one Ted Rice, has stated, as quoted in the St. John's Daily News with respect to injunctions:
If they are obtained they will be defied just as the back-to-work legislation has been. Twenty-three thousand workers stayed out on strike in the face of the legislation and injunctions are even a little milder.

Mr. Rice has questioned whether a judge will award an injunction, since the big question a judge will ask is whether the Post Office can guarantee that the injunction will be obeyed; and, since there can be no guarantee, he is doubtful that any will be obtained, and since the Newfoundland Federation of Labour has pledged full co-operation and support in defying the legislation, I move, seconded by the hon. member for Brandon-Souris (Mr. Dinsdale):
That the government explain in detail on motions how the government will ensure that any injunction is obeyed and how the government intends to enforce the law and to obtain respect for the law as a result of this massive and unprecedented defiance of the law in the courts by CUPW and the Newfoundland Federation of Labour.


Presentation of such a motion requires the unanimous consent of the House. Is there unanimous consent?


Agreed.


No.


Mr. Speaker, I rise on a matter of urgent necessity pertaining to testimony just given to the McDonald commission by former RCMP Commissioner Hig-gitt, investigating activities of the RCMP, testimony of the most serious nature alleging that three successive solicitors general were given both oral and written communications by Commissioner Higgitt concerning certain unusual police activities and that these cabinet ministers and the government failed to act in any way whatsoever.
I move, seconded by the hon. member for Lanark-Renfrew-Carleton (Mr. Dick):
That the Prime Minister and the government be ordered to make available immediately to the McDonald commission all details of such oral and written communications referred to by Commissioner Higgitt; further, that the Prime Minister explain this gross negligence on the part of the government in failing to act on the former commissioner's information and completely and utterly neglecting its obvious duty to reply to the commissioner for what must be interpreted as direct requests for instructions from the political level as to how the RCMP should proceed with its various activities.


Such a motion requires unanimous consent. Is there unanimous consent?


Agreed.


No.


privileges of members in the House I think it should be made in this form.
The testimony of Commissioner Higgitt of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police before the McDonald inquiry this morning raises matters, which affect the privileges of all members of the House. I would, therefore, move:
That the Prime Minister make an immediate statement on motions explaining the direct contradiction between the sworn testimony of the commissioner and previous statements made by himself and his ministers in this House, and that the Prime Minister table all written policy documents relating to this matter and referred to by the commissioner this morning.


Presentation of such a motion requires the unanimous consent of the House. Is there unanimous consent?


Agreed.


Mr. Speaker, I rise, under the provisions of Standing Order 43, to ask the unanimous consent of the House to deal with a matter of urgent and pressing necessity.
In view of the fact that an impasse has been reached between CUPW and the federal government which is without foreseeable resolution, and in view of the fact that this impasse has resulted in defiance of the law by 23,000 Canadian citizens who have reason to believe that this government is out to destroy their union, I move, seconded by the hon. member for Sault Ste. Marie (Mr. Symes):
That this House instructs the Prime Minister to insert himself into the dispute directly by calling both parties together, without preconditions, to negotiate a solution to the outstanding differences between CUPW and the Post Office.


Presentation of such a motion requires the unanimous consent of the House. Is there unanimous consent?


Agreed.


No.


Mr. Speaker, I rise, under the provisions of Standing Order 43, on a matter of urgent and pressing necessity.
Whereas the Canadian Union of Postal Workers is still defying the will of Canadians as expressed by parliament, and whereas the irresponsible leadership is continuing to advise its members to defy the law of the land, I move, seconded by the hon. member for Bruce-Grey (Mr. Douglas):
That the government act forthwith to decertify the Canadian Union of Postal Workers and that all the members of the national executive of that union who
House of Commons
have counselled sedition be charged with that crime and fired from the public payroll.


Presentation of such a motion requires the unanimous consent of the House. Is there unanimous consent?


Agreed.


No.


Mr. Speaker, I rise, under the provisions of Standing Order 43, on a matter of urgent and distressing necessity.
In light of the fact that the hon. member for Vaudreuil (Mr. Herbert), who has been appointed a parliamentary secretary and, therefore, occasionally answers for government policy in the House, yesterday moved a motion directing the government to discontinue federal transfer payments to the provinces for health, welfare and social services, payments which are the very linchpin of confederation, I move, seconded by the hon. member for Saskatoon-Biggar (Mr. Hnatyshyn):
That the House direct the Minister of Finance to make a statement on motions as to whether or not the motion by the parliamentary secretary is government policy, and whether or not the government condones such irresponsible action by a parliamentary secretary.


Presentation of such a motion requires unanimous consent. Is there unanimous consent?


Agreed.


No.


Order, please. In my view, the question period should continue until 15 minutes after three o'clock.


Before beginning the question period, may I ask all hon. members to join me in recognizing the presence in our gallery of two very distinguished visitors in the persons of Mr. Giovanni Miglinolo of the department of foreign affairs in Italy, and Mr. Norbert Prefontaine, assistant deputy minister, intergovernmental and international affairs branch, department of national health and welfare. They are here to sign a treaty with Canada.

October 24, 1978
Oral Questions


Mr. Speaker, my question to the Prime Minister has to do with the testimony given this morning to the McDonald royal commission by former RCMP Commissioner Higgitt who is reported as having said that he told three previous solicitors general that members of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police security service were breaking the law in carrying out their duties.
The Prime Minister will recall that on June 21, 1977, in this House, on a question of privilege, the Minister of Supply and Services said:
Not once, in my 23 months as Solicitor General, did any RCMP official suggest to me that the RCMP engage in illegal activities in the pursuit of its duties.
Clearly, there is an absolute and complete contradiction between the statement made by Mr. Higgitt this morning and the statement made by the present Minister of Supply and Services relative to his responsibilities in the period when he was solicitor general.
In light of that conflict, I wonder if the Prime Minister could tell us whether he has consulted the Minister of Supply and Services to determine whether the statement uttered in this House on privilege by that minister now stands. If he has not done that, can the Prime Minister tell us whether it is his intention to put that question to the present Minister of Supply and Services and whether he will give this House of Commons a complete report on the response of the Minister of Supply and Services?


Mr. Speaker, the minister has stated publicly and privately to me that he is not only willing, but anxious to testify before the royal commission. That is also the case with the Minister of Consumer and Corporate Affairs. They have said they are willing to testify. I think the least we could do would be to hear what their testimony will put before the commission.
[DOT] 0^32)
Certainly, Mr. Speaker, it does underline one of the difficulties of the present procedure in the commission whereby one testimony is made, it is picked up by the media, it is picked up by members opposite in the standing orders-as they did today-and based on allegations from one side which may well be dissipated in further examinations or cross-examinations and which certainly may be put in contradiction by further testimonies. I think this shows the wisdom of the government in saying, "Let us wait for the commission to make its report before jumping to conclusions."


Mr. Speaker, what we are dealing with here is a direct contradiction of a statement made by a former commissioner of the RCMP before the royal commission. Also, we are dealing with a statement made deliberately, after preparation

on a question of privilege by a minister of this government. There is a certain obligation of leadership of the Prime Minister.	i
My question has to do with whether or not the Prime Minister, in light of his obligation of leadership and in light of the testimony this morning by former Commissioner Higgitt, has done his duty and has spoken with the present Minister of Supply and Services to verify the accuracy or otherwise of the statement given by that minister to this House of Commons.
If the Prime Minister has not exercised his leadership relative to a statement given to this House of Commons, will he do that and report to the House of Commons fully upon the results of that conversation between himself and the minister of his government?


Mr. Speaker, it does happen to be the fact that not only have I exercised my leadership in this matter, but I have done this many, many months ago in talking to former solicitors general. I think it ill behoves the Leader of the Opposition to talk about leadership when he did not dare talk to the hon. member for Leeds when the RCMP wanted-


Hear, hear!


Shame!


The Leader of the Opposition makes a strong point of the fact that we are dealing with a direct contradiction. Indeed we are, Mr. Speaker, and we will be very anxious to find who in this contradiction is giving the proper interpretation of the facts. It just so happens that my information and my memory is, subject to verification, that former Commissioner Higgitt is in direct contradiction with himself who, if I am informed correctly, said before the Keable commission in Quebec not so many months ago that he had no recollection of having informed the former ministers of any such thing.
I urge the Leader of the Opposition to look up his files and to find out whether the former commissioner has or has not contradicted himself before, suggesting he has been contradicted by the former minister.


Hear, hear!


Mr. Speaker, I regret to find that the Prime Minister is behaving as usual.


Oh, oh!


Instead of doing his duty, he is attempting to attack me and former Commissioner Higgitt.


Oh, oh!


Hear, hear!


What is clear so far is that the Prime Minister, with the knowledge this morning of this quite remarkable testimony by former Commissioner Higgitt, has not so far, nor has he shown any indication of an intention to do his duty, in regard to verifying the accuracy of the statements made by the
October 24, 1978

now Minister of Supply and Services to the House of Commons.
I have a question, sir, that relates to an undertaking given by the Prime Minister of Canada to the House of Commons. It is germane in relation to the statement made this morning by former Commissioner Higgitt. The Prime Minister said in this House in answer to two questions on June 22, 1977 the following:
I have had repeated assurances from the commissioner of the RCMP and from the Director General of Security that this
The word "this" relates to an illegal act. The Prime Minister went on to say:
-was an isolated incident and it was in no way a general or special practice of the RCMP to have break-ins.
Can the Prime Minister tell us whether he stands by that statement made on June 22, 1977?


Mr. Speaker, yes, I stand by it absolutely. As a matter of fact, the statement was cleared with people in my office and in the RCMP who were working on this particular matter. In so far as doing my duty, it seems to me that I made it clear that I had talked to the former solicitor general in previous circumstances. So far as having done it today, I learned of this testimony over the lunch break. I had time to talk to the former solicitor general, who is now Minister of Consumer and Corporate Affairs and he assured me that former Commissioner Higgitt's testimony is not in conformity with what he has said on previous occasions. I have not had time to talk with the previous one.
I find it a little strange that the Leader of the Opposition stands up indignantly and says that I am attempting to attack him and former Commissioner Higgitt. It seems to me, Mr. Speaker, that the question period is a place where the opposition attacks the government. They have done nothing else in their question, and they did nothing else under the Standing Order. But I am not supposed to answer, because if I answer that it is seen as an attack on the poor Leader of the Opposition. '


Hear, hear!


Oh, oh!


Mr. Speaker, the question period is supposed to be a place where members of parliament can elicit information from the government. That has not been the case for the last ten years with this government.


Hear, hear!


The question that the Prime Minister should be putting to his long list of solicitors general does not deal with the consistency of Commissioner Higgitt's testimony, but deals with the question as to whether the testimony given today to the best of their knowledge is true. I wait to have an assurance from this Prime Minister that there will be a full revelation to this House of Commons of all the details of the efforts he has
Oral Questions
made to verify the record with the Minister of Supply and Services.
My question now relates to the invitation by former Commissioner Higgitt today that his advice to former solicitors general was in both oral and written form. May we have an unequivocal undertaking by the Prime Minister, now, that any written recommendations that are still extant will not be destroyed and will, instead, be made public to this House of Commons?


Hear, hear!


Mr. Speaker, we have given the undertaking that we would turn everything we have over to the royal commission. It has asked for many documents. It has had all it has asked for. We have given them more than that to introduce them to new facts. I think it is a very despicable slur to suggest that we would destroy information-


You sure would.


Who said that we sure would? I will kick his ass.


Shame.


Oh, oh!


Hear, hear!


Mr. Speaker, my question is to the Minister of Justice, in the absence of the Solicitor General. The Minister of Justice will be aware of the arguments advanced by council for the cabinet-I am not sure that council was acting for the Attorney General, because he would not tell us-to the effect that certain classes of government documents would only be made public at the option of the government. This argument was, of course, rejected by the commission. Would the Minister of Justice give an undertaking that the documentary material referred to this morning by former Commissioner Higgitt will be permitted to be made public and that the government will not seek any remedies to prevent such material being made public?
Would he also confirm that no argument will be advanced by cabinet before the commission in an effort to prevent the former commissioner testifying in public?


The hon. member, along with other hon. members, will be aware that we have taken a straightforward position that the material in our possession is available to the commission. That is a broad statement of our willingness to make available all that possibly could be of use to the commission. In addition, we have made it clear that we would expect the commission, obviously, to have regard for the public interest more broadly, that is, recognize the fact that there are certain classes of documents which deserve continued confidentiality

October 24, 1978
Oral Questions
in order that our national system may continue to operate well. That is our position and it is a position we shall continue to take before the commission.
I shall not engage in hypothetical, theoretical discussion about whether or not at some point we might get into some kind of confrontation. I do not foresee it. I foresee our making statements to the commission when the commission wants advice on issues of confidentiality. The decision will then be taken by the commission. As I see it, that approach has worked well up to this point. Of course, the opposition, which does not care about responsible investigating but only about partisan attacks, does not appreciate the fact. We continue to expect that approach to work well and I shall not engage in hypothetical alternatives.


It is very hard to imagine what is hypothetical about a vast number of documents already delivered to the McDonald commission. The question is not whether the government will make them available-they are already available-but whether the government will attempt to invoke or bring down a shroud of secrecy through the argument of its lawyers. I ask the minister for an assurance that the documentary material referred to by former Commissioner Higgitt will be made public without objection on the part of the government. Second, I ask for an assurance that the government will not invoke the infamous provisions of the Federal Courts Act, section 41, to prevent these documents being subject to public scrutiny.


I have made the position very clear and I invite the hon. member to read what I said, if he has not understood it. We shall make such arguments before the commission with regard to confidentiality as the public interest requires. I expect the commission to take its responsibility at that point with regard to the public interest and I do not propose to engage in further hypothetical discussion beyond that as to what might happen. Why not wait to see whether such a case ever arises, and then we can discuss the matter?


Mr. Speaker, I, too, would like to ask a question about the evidence of ex-Commissioner Higgitt. The ex-commissioner further testified before the inquiry that none of the solicitors-general- referring to Mr. Goyer, Mr. Mcllraith and Mr. Allmand- advised him at any time that the law should not be broken. The Minister of Justice is presently engaged in an effort to have the postal workers obey the rule of law and go back to work.
Given the evidence before the McDonald inquiry and the minister's stated objective of seeing that everyone in this country respects the rule of law, will the hon. gentleman now give an undertaking to the House that he will see that charges are laid forthwith against those who have violated the law as indicated by evidence before the McDonald inquiry, meaning both RCMP officers and cabinet ministers? Will that evidence be placed immediately before the attorneys general in the respective provinces so that appropriate charges may be laid?
(Mr. Lang.]


Of course, if anything arising out of the commission's inquiry deserves the attention of a provincial attorney general by showing any indication of a breach of the law, that information will be placed before him. But if we talk about observing the law and the spirit of the law, I would think it equally important for the hon. member from New Westminster and the Leader of the Opposition not to engage in conviction upon first glimpse of a suggestion of evidence, but to wait for due process of that very law.


Hear, hear!


I was referring, of course, to specific evidence, known for a long time, of mail openings, break-ins, barn burning, you name it. There is enough evidence for charges to be laid. If we expect the postal workers to go back to work, they want to see that there is not one law for them and another for the cabinet and the RCMP.
My supplementary question is a specific one with regard to the letters which were referred to ex-Commissioner Higgitt. Would the Minister of Justice agree to table those letters before the House so that we could examine the evidence? The minister is talking about prejudging: we will not prejudge them.


I would remind the hon. members, again, that the very reason the commission was set up, at the strong urging of the loyal and official opposition at least, was that all the material might be made available to the commission for an independent judgment. There was a very important point involved in that process. It was that a complete study might take place before conclusions were reached. We now find the hon. member for New Westminster arriving at conclusions on the basis of his glimpse of what must be at very best a tiny bit of evidence or suggestion. On that basis, the hon. member is not only weighing the evidence and reaching a conclusion, but he has so convicted some of my colleagues that he has used it as an argument for postal workers and CUPW to disobey the law, and that is outrageous.


Hear, hear!


My position has never been any different, and it is that everyone in this country should obey the law. And that includes postal workers. Can the minister at least make a commitment that he would not use the Federal Courts Act to suppress evidence concerning cabinet ministers, so that we may know publicly what the relationship is between those former cabinet ministers and the RCMP?


I have explained the situation. The commission has the matter in its hands. If it would help hon. members further, let me say this: I can conceive of no circumstances in which the commission, seeing that there is some suggestion of impropriety or illegality in a document or in testimony and, therefore, a need for it to be made public-I can conceive of no circumstances in which that decision of the commission would not be honoured and the documents made public.
October 24, 1978


Thank you, Mr. Speaker. My question is directed to the Minister of Fisheries and the Environment. Following the announcement that in future the private sector will have to conduct its own research in the field of fisheries, can the minister tell the House if small and medium fishing outfits, as well as fishermen, will have access to the information and knowledge acquired through scientific research by the large companies in this field?


Mr. Speaker, first I must specify that there is no scientific research involved among other things in determining the quantity of fish that can be taken. This research will be aimed at developing new fish products. We feel that the industry is sufficiently strong in this area to fend for itself. I have said it clearly, we will in no way reduce our scientific research nor our research aimed at improving the fishermen's equipment and increasing their catch.


Thank you, Mr. Speaker. As a supplementary question, I would like to ask the minister if, at that level, the small and medium outfits as well as the individual fisherman will be protected?


Mr. Speaker, no doubt that as small outfits band together to form associations, as they are already doing, they can take advantage of the information which may result from ongoing research.


Mr. Speaker, 1 have a supplementary question with respect to the evidence adduced before the McDonald commission this morning. My question is directed to the Prime Minister and it concerns the sworn testimony with respect to its being the general policy of the RCMP to engage in activities which are the subject matter of the inquiry.
My concern has to do with the direct contradiction which exists between statements, not only of previous solicitors general but also the Prime Minister's own statement made in the House in 1977 which is recorded at page 6988 of Hansard. The Prime Minister left the House with the impression that the matter was discussed. He said:
-very clearly with them-
Oral Questions
Presumably, the security officials of the RCMP.
-in my office in the spring of last year ... We had these specific assurances.
That is, that there were no specific break-ins. In view of that apparent contradiction, and in the interest of getting to the bottom of things and getting all the facts and the truth, will the Prime Minister be appearing before the McDonald commission to make known the facts within his knowledge with respect to the degree to which his previous ministers were aware of the general policy of the RCMP in this area?


Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is referring to a page in Hansard. I cannot remember the exact context of that quotation, but if my memory is right, I was reporting on a conversation which took place in my office between the commissioner of the RCMP, the then solicitor general, and perhaps one other member of the security service. The assurance I received then in my office, which I believe was quoted by the hon. member, had to do with the question of whether the one presumed illegal act which had been brought to light had been isolated or whether there had been many others.
At that time we were discussing the question of whether we should set up a royal commission of inquiry into the RCMP, and I was assured by the RCMP that this was an isolated act. They argued that there was no need, because of that, to set up a commission of inquiry, that it was an isolated act, that it had been uncovered and that the matter was before the courts. We wanted to set up a commission of inquiry.


No, we asked for it.


You had not even heard about it then. At that time the police were saying it was not necessary because this was an isolated act.
The hon. member went on to ask whether specific cases had been brought to our attention. I repeat that the only specific case which was brought to our attention was the one which had been made known then. It was, I believe, a break-in at offices in Montreal. I have before me the testimony of the commissioner at the Keable inquiry. I think this is public. Before the Keable inquiry, while referring to the interception of the private mail of citizens of Canada, Commissioner Higgitt said, in so many words, "No, I do not recall any such conversation". So this rather substantiates the fact that he had not raised such a matter with the then solicitor general.


Mr. Speaker, I have one further supplementary question. For the benefit of the Prime Minister's recollection, the exchange took place on June 22 with the leader of the New Democratic Party. The Prime Minister is quite correct in his summary of his recollection, but I am not concerned here about a specific instance. In his testimony before the Keable inquiry, the commissioner was referring to a specific incident. The Prime Minister is referring to a specific incident, but I am referring to general policy.
It is inconceivable to me that, as chairman of the cabinet committee on security, the Prime Minister would not be aware

October 24, 1978
Oral Questions
of the general policy of the RCMP. As Commissioner Higgitt testified under oath, today, the general policy was to condone not only these specific incidents but also several others. That is the clear purport of his testimony.
In view of the fact that the Prime Minister and his former solicitors general should be, if they are not, fully aware of the general policy in this area, does the Prime Minister not think, in the interest of getting all the facts, that he should testify before the McDonald commission with respect to the policy areas which were testified to this morning?


Mr. Speaker, I repeat that I do not have the testimony of Commissioner Higgitt. I doubt very much that he was saying what the hon. member quotes him as saying, that there is a general policy on the part of the government to support the RCMP in its breaking of the law. If the commissioner says that, that is flatly denied by his own testimony before the Keable commission. It is flatly denied by the solicitors general under which he has served, and certainly no such conversation ever came up in my presence or with him.


Mr. Speaker, my supplementary question is to the Prime Minister, not only in his capacity as Prime Minister but also as chairman of the cabinet committee on security matters. Can the Prime Minister tell us whether the letters, documents and memoranda referred to this morning by former Commissioner Higgitt have actually been turned over by the government to the royal commission?


Mr. Speaker, I have never heard of any such documents. The former solicitor general says he has no recollection of any such documents. I do not think Commissioner Higgitt has produced any such documents. The government has made all its material available to the royal commission of inquiry, and I suggest that the advice of the Minister of Justice is the best. Let the commission do its work. Let us at least have the elementary fairness not to condemn one side until we have heard the other side. This is a rule which the opposition should keep in mind once in a while.


Mr. Speaker, I would like to direct a question to the Minister of Justice: it has to do with the Post Office fiasco. We are now seeing the rule of law versus the rule of power with regard to the injunctions which the minister has been seeking. We find now that CUPW is not going to respect them. Police chiefs and police in general are reluctant to move. They say that perhaps there might be a breach of the peace if they did.

The minister must be in touch with the attorneys general across the country in order to see that the situation is brought to their attention and that they move and give directions, rather than several chiefs of police. Has the minister been in touch with the attorneys general across this country in order to put the position of the government before them so that the proper action can be taken?


Mr. Speaker, in cases where it is relevant, my deputies or other officials have been in touch with their counterparts in the various provinces. It is true that because we are applying the rule of the law rather than some rule of arbitrary power, the matter must necessarily take some time and some careful consideration and deliberation. That is true, but I still ask hon. members to join in the basic argument that what we must have is obedience of the law, we must have due process, no doubt moving slowly but moving inexorably just the same.
So let us not make it sound in the House as if it were some sort of confrontation between government and a particular group. This is confrontation against the law of this land itself and we will continue to apply that law slowly, carefully and properly, because in applying it-the hon. member for New Westminster says "very slowly"-very slowly, deliberately and properly, as we would in every case, we would not want in any way to be open to any feeling of disrespect of the law and the legal system which is being defied in this flagrant way.


Hear, hear!


I am glad the minister understands the situation, because the people of Canada are looking to the House for leadership in this regard. The minister indicated he was gathering the evidence, all the facts, in order that prosecutions can be laid. Can the minister rise in his place now and tell us whether he has the facts to enable prosecutions to be laid, and what type of prosecutions he is referring to? After all, this is the second or third day that has gone by in the gathering of facts in order to prosecute. Has the minister prosecuted-and to what extent?


Thirsty for blood, Line?


We have obtained injunctions in a number of locations and those injunctions have been served. We are continuing to seek injunctions in other cases in order to remove the biggest obstacle which inhibits those in the union who would want to return to work. We are, indeed, preparing the material for charges of a variety of sorts, and those will be against a variety of people involved in breaking the law.
While it would be very tempting, politically, for me to make broad statements about whom we will charge and what kind of charges those will be, I will not fall into that political trap against the obligations I have as Attorney General to, first, assess evidence carefully laid before me and, second, lay the

charges and then be able to say that those charges have been laid.


Hear, hear!


Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Acting Minister of Labour. There were reports yesterday that the leader of CUPW had said categorically that he would refuse to meet with the hon. Lucien Tremblay whom the minister appointed yesterday as mediator-arbitrator. Today, however, there is a press release-and I am quoting from it-put out by the leader of CUPW which says:
However, we wish to reiterate that we are ready to meet any person appointed by the government with a view to resolving the issues that gave rise to the present dispute.
I know that the acting minister understands that if there is an absolute refusal to meet with the hon. Lucien Tremblay, then the whole nexus of the legislation falls apart. Can the minister tell us what the situation is?


Mr. Speaker, in this regard the course of action which ought to be followed by the union is quite clear. It has been decided by parliament that the mediator-arbitrator would be appointed and that he will try, in the first instance, to bring the parties together to try to arrive at a negotiated settlement, and if he is not successful in achieving this, he will turn into an arbitrator, a responsibility which has been given to him by parliament; and he will draft a collective agreement which will have force and effect on both parties, on the government on one hand and on the union on the other hand. That collective agreement will be in force until the end of 1979.


I have a final supplementary, Mr. Speaker. Has the Acting Minister of Labour any information which can clarify what are, not apparently but clearly, conflicting statements made by the leader of CUPW, one of them yesterday, in which he is reported to have said that he would not meet with the mediator-arbitrator, and the second statement today that while he is critical of the choice of that particular person, nonetheless he will meet with anybody appointed by the government.
Can the minister clarify for the House just what is going on, because it is obvious to all of us that it would be preferable to have the union meet with the mediator-arbitrator?


It is very difficult indeed for me to give an interpretation of two different statements made by the president of CUPW. But I am glad to see in his second statement that he is now starting to understand the fact that parliament has established a course of action which he ought to follow, that if he wants to present his point of view in order to have, for his own sake and that of his members, a better collective agreement, he should sit down with the mediator-arbitrator and present his point of view, because the course of action of the mediator-arbitrator has been set by parliament and within 90 days he will have to draft a new collective agreement. I am sure he will do it. This agreement will be imposed, I repeat, not only on the union but on the government.
Oral Questions


Mr. Speaker, my supplementary question is directed to the Postmaster General. In view of the continuing defiance by CUPW and the counselling of its executive that members defy the law, has the Postmaster General asked the government to start proceedings to decertify the union, and will the government take steps to fire those public servants who counsel defiance of the law?


In answer to the hon. member's question, I should like to advise him and members of the House that this morning a memorandum was sent by the Deputy Postmaster General to the CUPW bargaining unit, and in that memorandum the deputy minister advised members of CUPW that, under the Public Service Employment Act, any employee who failed to report for normal duties during the seven days ending at 12.01 a.m. on October 26, 1978, may be declared to have abandoned the position he or she had occupied.
This could lead to the termination of employment with the Post Office.


Hear, hear!

Mr. Speaker, my question is directed to the Minister of State for Urban Affairs.
On August 31 last, the minister announced to the residents of Place Frontenac in Montreal that as a pilot project, he wanted to set up a management committee for those buildings. Considering that the Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation stated recently that it wished to set up a non-profit company to manage those apartments, is the minister in a position to say why he does not extend the 12-month mandate which included a clause providing for its extension?


Mr. Speaker, indeed the Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation which was the owner of Place Frontenac in Montreal decided to make a rather special experiment with that housing complex by setting up a joint management under which the tenants of those apartments met with the directors of the corporation to organize the joint management of that complex. We then said that if the experience was successful we would be prepared to offer the apartment for sale to the tenants who through a non-profit company would become owners of that complex. We are now negotiating the sale of Place Frontenac to tenants who have set up a non-profit company which will become the owner of the building.

Oral Questions


I have a supplementary question, Mr. Speaker. In view of the fact that this morning, in Montreal I think, the president of the management committee expressed deep concern and regretted and complained about not receiving from the corporation the information they should provide him, can the minister give the required information, is the minister prepared to meet with the tenants and in particular with the responsible management committee in order to settle this question in the best interests of the tenants?


Yes, Mr. Speaker, 1 did meet with this management committee in the past. Obviously, I will be happy to meet them again if there are some points to be clarified.


Mr. Speaker, my question is directed to the Minister of Transport and Minister of Justice. In view of the decision by Canadian National to prosecute individually 137 members of the United Transportation Union, local 913, in Thunder Bay, for a wildcat strike caused by CN demanding that train crews work longer than the hours stipulated in the collective agreement, in the interest of industrial peace, will the minister talk to CN management in an attempt to convince them that there is no useful purpose in prosecuting these employees now that a compromise has been worked out for a trial period?


Mr. Speaker, I would be glad to have that representation made known to the management of Canadian National. As hon. members know, it is not my ordinary practice to interfere in the day to day operations of CN. However, in referring to the action as a prosecution, perhaps the hon. member has misstated the situation. I believe it may involve civil actions.


Mr. Speaker, my supplementary question is directed to the Acting Minister of Labour. Will he have his officials investigate the situation with the United Transportation Union and Canadian National in Thunder Bay, to determine if the company is acting illegally or contrary to the intent of the collective agreement, and to see if, through his good offices, the dispute can be resolved?


Yes, Mr. Speaker.


Mr. Speaker, I will not ask any questions about the retired commissioner, because I have been always under the impression that there should be no threats in parliament. But after the eloquent description of the kind of treatment that certain members of the opposition will receive, as expressed by the Prime Minister a few moments ago, I will not ask the questions I had in mind, because I would not want him to start into some other fuddle-duddle words!


Oh, oh!


My question is directed to the Minister of Transport and Minister of Justice, as the minister reporting for the Wheat Board. In the last few days there was a meeting in Washington in connection with the price of wheat. Among other things, the discussions were leading up to an international wheat agreement. The Canadian participants in the Canada and American Senate wheat talks came to the conclusion that until farmers received $4 a bushel, they would not have sufficient money to pay their cost of production and receive any return. Will he give consideration to bringing before the Wheat Board the need of action in this regard?
It would not mean any particular increase in the cost of living, but it would place hundreds of thousands-tens of thousands-of western farmers in a position which they are not in today.


Mr. Speaker, I presume the right hon. member is not suggesting the destruction of the Wheat Board system and the initial payment system. Therefore, he should take note of the fact that the farmer receives part of his return by way of initial price, and the rest by way of final payment.
While the price of the elevator does not reflect the fact that wheat is being sold by the Wheat Board for over $4 a bushel, I would have thought the right hon. member for Prince Albert would have known that for some number of months now the Wheat Board has in fact sold wheat at prices ranging between $4.30 and $4.70 a bushel. At the present time at least the returns for our grain are above the minimum to which he referred.


Mr. Speaker, I am fully aware of what the minister is saying. Whenever he expresses himself on any subject, naturally I give the greatest attention to it. I should like to ask him the simplest question. Having regard to the market as it now is, why can the farmer not receive $4 a bushel at the time of sale? Because the minister has said that the sales ahead indicate a price beyond that, that is a pertinent question to ask. Even his constituents in Saskatoon-Humboldt might be interested in learning whether the minister is interested in their prosperity.
October 24, 1978


Mr. Speaker, I think the grain farmer realizes, in setting the initial price, that we often take the recommendations of the Canadian Wheat Board into account. In March of this year we set it at $3 for this year. We did so in March, 1977, for the past crop year. In both cases the government was taking significant risk regarding the possible deficit in those pools and was not advised by the Canadian Wheat Board to reach for so high a price. Prices have moved upward and are at a higher level now. I am glad about that. We will make every effort we can in the international negotiations under way to assure fair returns for our farmers from the international marketplace. That is where the farmer would most like to achieve it.
However, in the alternative we have available such things as the grain stabilization plan, for which the Conservatives fought so bitterly for so many years, and which this year has paid out $ 115 million to prairie farmers.


Mr. Speaker, in so far as the grain stabilization plan is concerned, the minister and those connected with him gave farmers a ride. The Minister of Agriculture said that the farmers would secure a further payment from $110 million to $140 million. When the payment was made, it was $55 million. In other words, farmers were taken for a ride, and the last thing the minister should do is boast about the success of that particular plan.


Mr. Speaker, earlier it was made clear in the House that any reference by the Minister of Agriculture to the final payment under the scheme which farmers would receive was to the total payment they would receive.


No.


I made that clear, and that was very clear in everything said. Once again, it is quite wrong for the right hon. member for Prince Albert to attempt to perpetrate or put forward the notion that somehow an unfairness is being done to a sector of our economy. That is not so.


It is so.


The House and the government, through the grain stabilization plan, hopper cars and railway rehabilitation, have done things such as the right hon. membe
