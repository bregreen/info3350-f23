Mr. Speaker, I wish to move a motion under Standing Order 43, seconded by the hon. member for Louis-Hebert (Mr. Dawson):
That this House congratulates the hon. member for Winnipeg North Centre, the dean of the House, on his impending appointment as a member of the Queen's Privy Council for Canada, recognizes this as his first step toward membership in the Senate, and urges the government to consider similar honours for the well respected hon. member for Peace River who is the last excuse for the use of the word "progressive" in the name of the governing party.

Mr. Speaker, under the provisions of Standing Order 43, I ask for the unanimous consent of the House to move a motion dealing with an urgent matter of pressing necessity.
Considering the growing dissatisfaction of Longueuil residents about the quality of services provided by the Societe Cablevision Nationale, a dissatisfaction increased by the presence in the constituency of two cablevision companies, namely Telecable Videotron and Cablevision Nationale which do not provide the same services to their subscribers; and considering the superior quality of the picture and programming given by the Videotron Co. Ltd. to meet the needs of the residents of Longueuil, I move, seconded by the hon. member for Laprairie (Mr. Deniger):
That the House urge the Minister of Communications to make the necessary representations to the CRTC so that this federal organization strongly intervene with the Societe Cablevision Nationale Ltee and make it come to an understanding with Compagnie Videotron Ltee so that the citizens of the constituency of Longueuil will enjoy a consistent service.


The House has heard the motion of the hon. member. Under the provisions of Standing Order 43, in order to be presented such a motion requires unanimous consent. Is there unanimous consent?


Agreed.


No.


Mr. Speaker, I have a serious motion to present under the provisions of Standing Order 43. I therefore move, seconded by the hon. member for Yorkton-Melville (Mr. Nystrom):
That this House notes the solemn declaration in the government's position paper on the reform of Parliament, tabled on November 23, that the House of Commons is worthy of more than the cynical cliches, "rubber stamp", "flock of sheep", "trained seals", but that this solemn declaration has been torn up like a scrap of paper by the announcement yesterday that the income tax forms for 1979 have been printed and will be mailed before this House has even voted on Bill C-20, the provisions of which are already in the forms that have been printed and are to be mailed shortly, and that this House registers its strong protest against this blatant contempt of Parliament.


Shame.


Hear, hear!


This motion, pursuant to Standing Order 43, can be presented for debate at this time only with the unanimous consent of the House. Is there unanimous consent?


Agreed.


No.


Mr. Speaker, under the provisions of Standing Order 43, I request the

November 29, 1979
unanimous consent of the House to present a motion dealing with an important and urgent matter.
In view of the accusation of the hon. member for Longueuil (Mr. Olivier) concerning the embezzlement of funds paid by the federal government to labour unions for educational purposes and in view of the fact that the hon. member did not prove his allegations, I move, seconded by the hon. member for Winnipeg North Centre (Mr. Knowles):
That the House request the hon. member for Longueuil to withdraw his accusation and apologize to the workers for having irresponsibly cast aspersions on their integrity.


The House has heard the motion of the hon. member. Under Standing Order 43, the motion requires the unanimous consent of the House. Is there unanimous consent?


Agreed.


No.


Mr. Speaker, I rise, under the provisions of Standing Order 43, on a serious matter of urgent and pressing necessity. In view of the strong expression of community opposition to the development of non-public uses of Cartier Square in Ottawa, in view of the soon to be finalized decisions to be taken by the federal government in this regard, and in view of the fact that no public or community input was sought by the federal government prior to last night, I move, seconded by the hon. member for Moncton (Mr. McCauley):
That this House supports the request of the residents of Ottawa and instructs the government to freeze for three months all final decisions on Cartier Square in order to allow full public consultation, discussion and input into future land use.


This motion can be presented for debate at this time only with the unanimous consent of the House. Is there unanimous consent?


Agreed.


No.


Mr. Speaker, I rise, under the provisions of Standing Order 43, to seek the unanimous consent of the House. As a result of the high
interest rate situation in Canada and restrictions in the Small Loans Act which place limitations on co-operative credit associations and caisses populaires, it is financially impossible for them to lend amounts less than $1,500.
This situation tends to drive the small loan borrower to either borrow more than $1,500, an amount in excess of what he needs, or to seek out other lenders, both scrupulous or unscrupulous, therefore threatening the existence of the co-ops and caisses populaires, the very organizations designed to help the small borrower. Therefore, I move, seconded by the hon. member for Scarborough West (Mr. Wightman):
That this House commends the Minister of Consumer and Corporate Affairs for having commenced urgently needed studies of the inadequacies of the Small Loans Act and that it urges the minister and the Minister of Finance to repeal quickly the said Small Loans Act which unduly restricts the lending capabilities of the co-operative credit associations and caisse populaires and, in so restricting them, reduces and even eliminates their inability to provide appropriate lending service to their lenders and small loan borrowers, thus denying needed funds, forcing greater borrowing-


Order.


Order, please. I am sure the hon. member would not want me to encourage the use of Standing Order 43 for members to commend members on their own side of the House.


Send them flowers.


Mr. Speaker, under the provisions of Standing Order 43, I request the unanimous consent of the House to present a motion dealing with an urgent matter.
In view of the representations made this morning to the Standing Committee on Fisheries and Forestry by the Quebec commercial fishing delegation, I move, seconded by the hon. member for Manicouagan (Mr. Maltais):
That the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans announce immediately that large fishing vessels of 100 feet or more can no longer fish cod commercially in the Gulf of St. Lawrence.


The House has heard the motion of the hon. member. Under the terms of Standing Order 43, the motion requires the unanimous consent of the House. Is there unanimous consent?


Agreed.


No.
[Mr. Nystrom.J
November 29, 1979


Before beginning the oral question period, may I ask hon. members to join with me in signalling the presence in our gallery of a distinguished visitor on an official visit to our country, in the person of the Undersecretary General of the United Nations and Executive Director of the United Nations Fund for Population Activities, Dr. Rafael Salas.


Hear, hear!


Mr. Speaker, earlier in this House, the Prime Minister indicated that he had an oil pricing agreement with the government of Alberta. Today we have a statement by Mr. Merv Leitch, the minister of energy for Alberta, who specifically said the following:
An oil pricing agreement is months away and certainly will not come in time for the December 11 federal budget.
Will the right hon. Prime Minister tell us who is telling the truth in this game, what the people of Canada can really expect, and where he stands on this issue?


Who speaks for Canada, Joe?


Oh, oh!


Mr. Speaker, when there is some quiet on the other side, I can assure the hon. member for Outremont-as I assured members of the House yesterday-that when the budget is brought down on the eleventh day of December, it will reflect the fiscal elements of an energy package. I can assure him, also, that on the basis of the discussions we have had with Alberta we are proceeding directly and immediately with planning and bringing into place elements of a national energy package far more comprehensive than any envisaged by the former government when they were in office.


The one thing that is clear, Mr. Speaker, about the energy package is that the Canadian public is going to be hit with a massive tax increase, particularly in the form of an excise tax which it appears will increase the price of gasoline by at least 25 per cent in one stroke. I want to ask the
Oral Questions
Prime Minister, in light of his previous statement, how he can justify such an appalling increase in the price of gasoline, particularly in light of his own statement in this House on July 18, 1975, when he objected to any excise tax on gasoline and stated specifically "that an excise tax on gasoline applies unfairly to the weakest elements of society."


Mr. Speaker, the details of the energy package we have been working on, in the absence of that kind of comprehensive work having been done by the former government, will be known fairly shortly. As I indicated yesterday, we have agreement on all of the major principles and are working now on the development of a mechanism to ensure the effective collection of a tax that will allow the federal government to engage in and to help the private sector of Canada engage in energy developments in the country.
We believe that kind of proposal and that kind of package is essential now, because we cannot accept the legacy we received from the former government of increasing Canadian dependence upon insecure foreign sources of oil.


Hear, hear!


Mr. Speaker, since we cannot get a straight answer from the Prime Minister, may I go to the Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources?


You won't get anything from him, either; it's a waste of time.


Oh, oh!


1 will try. As it is becoming more and more obvious that the Prime Minister was taken to the cleaners by the Premier of Alberta during their meeting last Monday, and as it is quite apparent that the government is intent on proceeding with its "baseball bat" approach to energy conservation in this country, will the minister-


Oh, oh!


I see the spokesmen for Imperial Oil are agitated on the other side.


Oh, oh!


Will the minister, rather than bad-mouthing Canadians, as he did last night, impress upon his colleagues in cabinet the necessity of increasing old age pensions and other social benefits by an amount that will be at least equivalent to the unconscionable increases they are talking about in terms of oil and gas prices?


Mr. Speaker, I can only respond to the hon. member by telling him that as part of the energy package we are, indeed, and will be, looking after considerations in respect of the macroeconomic effects of any price increase. I want to assure the hon. member that this is very much in our minds.

November 29, 1979
Oral Questions
There will be a cost exacted in respect of obtaining energy self-sufficiency. This country cannot rely upon offshore oil. The hon. member may point to people on this side of the House or on his side of the House as being representatives of Imperial Oil, but that is much better than being a representative of Seagram.
[DOT] (M20)


You can't drink oil.


Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources. As the minister knows, on March 29, 1979, a telex was received by his department from the minister of energy of Venezuela, wherein the minister stated that he hoped to strengthen energy relations with Canada through state-to-state energy arrangements, and to increase the volume of oil supplies to customers of Venezuela.
In view of that country's announcement to cut back its oil supplies by 6 per cent, what has the minister done to gain assurance from Venezuela that Canada will have the supplies we were promised and that Venezuela will follow through on the promise it gave last March?


Mr. Speaker, before any speculative stories get into the press with respect to the possible intentions of Venezuela, I personally visited with General Alfonso Rivard, the head of Petroleos de Venezuela, on Monday of this week to discuss the general relationship between our two countries. General Alfonso informed me that he has a very high regard for the relationship which has existed between our two countries over the course of the last 30 years, and he assured me that Canada would receive priority attention with respect to oil supplies coming from that country. I hope that this information will put the hon. member's mind at rest.


Mr. Speaker, I would like to be reassured by what the hon. minister has said, but it is difficult in view of his denial yesterday of the accuracy of a report by CTV that oil supplies to eastern Canada are in fact worse than previously estimated, and his confirmation of this very fact today as reported in the newspapers.
Can the minister tell the House what precautionary measures he has taken-such as getting written assurances from the oil companies that they will not divert oil supplies from Canada-to assure Canadians that oil supply will meet the demand this winter?


Mr. Speaker, I repeat that I have taken a number of initiatives with respect to the oil supply situation for this winter. There is no question about the fact that we are in a very tight and fragile situation, but we are attempting to build up our inventory. I pointed this out yesterday to the hon. member when I was before the committee, and that we in Canada cannot assume that there are limitless supplies of oil.

The people of Canada must co-operate to conserve supplies. I make that statement now to the hon. member and to the people of Canada in general. It is a situation that we can overcome with co-operation, and I am sure the people of Canada will do everything they can to get us through the winter.


Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of National Defence. It appears that there is a scandal in the making with regard to the fighter procurement program. Has the minister received a confidential memo from a senior departmental official indicating that vital information pertaining to the purchase of new fighter aircraft is being kept from cabinet? If he has seen that memo, what action is he taking, and is he prepared to table it in the House?


Mr. Speaker, I saw the memo in question about two weeks ago. The memo was addressed by an individual to his superior within the department and was never intended to go higher than that.


Oh, oh!


When I heard about the matter, 1 asked for the memo and I received it. The memo does not say that there is a scandal going on with regard to the procurement of the new fighter aircraft-far from it.


Mr. Speaker, it is clear that there has been some stonewalling and cover-up with regard to the purchase of the new fighter aircraft. Is the minister prepared to place a moratorium on the purchase of these aircraft, and refer the whole matter of this $4.5 billion purchase to the standing committee for a full and complete investigation and analysis, in order that the Canadian taxpayer will not be saddled with a flying white elephant?


Mr. Speaker, I disagree entirely with the thesis and the delusion under which the hon. member is operating. As far as debating it in committee is concerned, the hon. member was at the committee, I believe, the day before yesterday and had an opportunity to raise the matter. He will have another opportunity, I believe, within the next five days to do the same thing.
The progress of the new fighter aircraft purchase is proceeding. I see no reason to put it on the shelf, as the New Democratic Party would like us to do to ensure that the armed forces of Canada are completely disarmed.


Mr. Speaker, in light of the minister's answers to my first two questions, and in light of the govern-
November 29, 1979

ment's commitment to freedom of information, would he answer the first question 1 asked? Will he table this memo in the House?


Mr. Speaker, I do not see much value in tabling it in the House.


Open government!


It was almost entirely a rephrasing of Peter Ward's article that ran some three weeks ago. I will be glad to show it to the hon. member in confidence, if he does not have it already.


My question is for the Prime Minister, Mr. Speaker. On November 20 I asked the first minister if his government was prepared to accept amendments to Bill C-20. His response was:
-this government, naturally, will consider reasonable amendments-
Yesterday, the government House leader indicated that the government was going to proceed with Bill C-20 without accepting any amendments whatsoever and, in fact, is going forward with printing tax forms without giving any consideration to representations by members of the opposition, thus making a sham of the parliamentary process.
I should like to know from the Prime Minister if he has once again reversed his position, as he has before, and gone back on his statement of November 20. Or is he prepared to repudiate the statements made by the House leader yesterday and allow this House to continue the honourable and orderly discussion of Bill C-20, including the representations and amendments put forward by members of Parliament, as they have a right to do?


Mr. Speaker, we are, naturally, prepared to have consideration of the bill and of amendments; but the House should know that given printing deadlines-which are well known to members of the former government-it is necessary for us to issue and to put in the mail tomorrow tax forms based upon certain premises. That is a practice that has been followed before, and it is a practice that is being followed now.
If hon. members on the other side want to delay progress of this bill, then we will-as the government House leader indicated the other day-be forced to indicate to the people of Canada that the reason they have been denied the benefits of the tax credit program has been-


Oh, oh!


Blackmail.
Oral Questions


-an attempt by members of the opposition- who even now are trying to shout me down and, indeed, by their conduct throughout this matter have been trying to delay passage of legislation which we believe is very much in the interests of the people of Canada.


Hear, hear!


A supplementary question, Mr. Speaker. If the Prime Minister is going to the people with these kinds of allegations, is he also prepared to explain why his government waited 41 days into this session to bring the legislation forward? Is he prepared to tell the people of Canada why his government refused to vote on the bill, as this party asked to do yesterday, and prepare to move the bill into committee so it can be given proper consideration? Is he prepared to tell the truth to the Canadian people about the sham allegations he is suggesting now?


Mr. Speaker, I certainly am prepared to continue to tell the people of Canada the truth. The truth is-


Start.


Oh, oh!


I am interrupted by the hon. member for Out-remont, that expert on the truth-


Oh, oh!


Hear, hear!


-whose expertise is such that when it is noted, it is celebrated by one of his former colleagues.


Oh, oh!


The fact is, as is well known to the House, that the reason the tax credit legislation was introduced when it was, was that members of the Liberal party in particular delayed substantially consideration by this House of Commons of budget measures carried over from the budget introduced by the former Liberal government.


Oh, oh!


We were obliged, Mr. Speaker, to deal with business that they could not get dealt with before calling the election. Once that was dealt with, we introduced the tax credit legislation so that there would be a wide and adequate opportunity for the House to debate it and for Canadians to receive the benefits of the program.


Hear, hear!

Mr. Speaker, my question is also directed to the Prime Minister. In the debate on Bill C-20 we have tried to demonstrate the extravagance of the bill and to propose reasonable alternatives, such as a shelter allowance for the elderly and single-parent families, which would have a relatively small cost of $145 million per year according to CMHC estimates. Can the Prime Minister tell us when he will introduce legislation to provide for a shelter allowance for people in need?


Mr. Speaker, I cannot give that information now. I can say to the hon. member that the question of shelter allowance is actively being considered within the government. I welcome the indication of interest on the part of the hon. member and 1 hope it is shared by several of his colleagues in co-operating with the government in taking this first step toward helping Canadians-the first step being the tax credit program. Other measures we are certainly prepared to consider, including a shelter allowance.


Hear, hear!

Mr. Speaker, my question is directed to the Minister of the Environment. In view of the information that seven teenagers are reported to have died after inhaling fluorocarbons from pressurized cans of cooking oil, in view of the fact that the Minister of Consumer and Corporate Affairs refuses to regulate spray-on cooking oil cans under the Hazardous Products Act, and in view of the fact that some uses of fluorocarbons are already in the process of being banned under the Environmental Contaminants Act, I ask the Minister of the Environment to tell us whether he is prepared to add fluorocarbons in cooking oils to the list of uses of fluorocarbons to be banned under the Environmental Contaminants Act, for the protection of human health and the environment?


Mr. Speaker, I will consider the representations of the hon. member.

Mr. Speaker, earlier this week I put a question to the Minister of Labour. In spite of the problems he had understanding it, can he tell us now whether he has received, as provided for in agreements signed by labour unions of Canada, the financial statements on expenses for labour education under the $10 million labour education program covering a five-year period? Can the minister tell us now whether there were any irregularities and, if not, can he confirm that he has received the report and will table it?


Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the hon. member for bringing this matter to my attention once again. The hon. member is quite right when he indicates that there is a $10 million program regarding labour education over a period of approximately five years. I can assure the hon. member that those who have entered into contracts-that would be the CLC, the CSN and others, including other teamsters-under the contract have to submit progress reports, or reports on their activities. These are audited by the audit service.
I can further advise the hon. member that with respect to the contract, as he very well knows, after the second year that the program has been in place there should be an evaluation study made by independent, impartial people. There are three people who are doing just that. Also, after the fourth year, notwithstanding the interim study, there will be a full study as to the effectiveness and the efficacy of the program.
With respect to the member's important question-as he may think-whether there are any irregularities or investigations, I have had a thorough interview with my officials with respect to this matter: we have found no irregularities, and as far as we are concerned there are no investigations in progress. But I think, Mr. Speaker, in all fairness, if the hon. member wants to help-and I know he does because this is the role he plays as an opposition critic, as I did-he should perhaps indicate to me-


Order.


-the people he thinks-


Order.


Mr. Speaker, first, it is precisely because the cause of labour education is very important to me that I asked these questions. Second, I expected the minister to state his position and deny these accusations. My
(Mr. Clark.]
November 29, 1979

supplementary question is for the Solicitor General. Under what authority is this inquiry being carried on? Are RCMP officers actually investigating under the pretext or on the assumption that there have been irregularities within labour unions regarding the labour education program? Can the Solicitor General tell us why they are using that pretext and, if such is not the case, under what authority can they investigate certain procedures used by union officers?


Mr. Speaker, as a result of the member's general inquiry the other day, I made inquiries at the commissioner's level and the headquarters' level of the RCMP about these general allegations. They professed as much ignorance as 1 professed as far as any investigation at the headquarters' level is concerned. There may well be some criminal investigation at a detachment level across this country about which headquarters knows nothing, about which the commissioner knows nothing and, subsequently, about which 1 know nothing.
It would certainly help me if the hon. member, either publicly or privately, would be more specific as to the particular union he is concerned about and what particular funds. 1 would then be able to give him a much more specific answer.


Mr. Speaker, 1 have a very gentle question to direct to the Prime Minister.


Oh, oh!


Yesterday, the Prime Minister, in response to a question by the hon. member for York Centre, said he would look into a $100,000 patronage contract obtained by Decima Research Limited which is associated intimately, 1 am told, with the Progressive Conservative Party. I would like to ask whether he will, as well, look into why Decima also received- again without competitive tender-a $50,000 research contract from the Department of Energy, Mines and Resources in late August, early September; and is the Prime Minister now prepared to tell the House that he is going to stop the use of patronage in awarding government contracts and services which are paid for by all the taxpayers of our country?


Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the question from the hon. member. We are continuing to look into the question raised yesterday by the hon. member for York Centre.
I shall certainly report to the House the results of that inquiry. I can now give the hon. member and the House of Commons the undertaking that because of the very real confidence the government has in the competence of the organization referred to, and to allay any suspicion as to the effective-
Oral Questions
ness of the work or the uses of the work, we will be quite prepared to make available to hon. members-or, indeed, to the House, if that is desired-the results of the polling once that polling is completed.


Mr. Speaker, while we are on this lovely, tender topic, I would like to ask the minister whether he would now investigate, as well, the awarding last summer of a $30 million contract to Media Buying Services Limited, headed by one Peter Swain who directed the Progressive Conservative advertising campaign during the recent federal election.


Oh, oh!


Would he explain to the House why this contract was awarded-again without competitive tender-to provide services which are presently and currently being supplied by the Department of Supply and Services?


Oh, oh!


Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is a little confused as to the details of some of the allegations he has placed before the House. But I can indicate to the hon. member and to the House that, because this government was determined to reduce the amount of spending on advertising by the Government of Canada-


Oh, oh!


-and because we were determined to bring some pattern and co-ordination into the advertising programs of the Government of Canada, we instituted a new agency, working through the Department of Supply and Services, which we are convinced will, among other things, increase the effectiveness of government advertising and reduce the possibilities of abuse.


Mr. Speaker, I have a question for the Prime Minister on the same subject. It arises out of a visit I paid this morning to the Agency of Management, on Albert Street. Since the election, that firm has opened two large offices in different Canadian cities to give away government contracts for advertising and for research. In spite of the allegation by the Prime Minister that this is being done to establish things on a more businesslike basis, no contract has been signed with the Agency of Management.
Does the Prime Minister feel that he has friendly enough relations with the owners of this private company to ensure that, after all the work they have done and the investment they have made, he will be able to enter into a contract with them that will be fair to them and to the Canadian taxpayers as well; or does he intend at the end of it to make them an offer they cannot refuse?


Hear, hear!

November 29, 1979
Oral Questions


Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the hon. member's concern for the company. I can assure him that, simply as a result of the high reputation of that company, there is no concern about their position. I can also indicate to the hon. member that it is a deliberate decision of the government- and a view to which we adhere very strongly-that the Agency of Management approach which we have introduced, as a government, to the field of federal government advertising is significantly preferable to the positions that prevailed previously in their ability to reduce abuses and in their ability to reduce the costs of advertising to the government and to the people of Canada.


Mr. Speaker, we will see about the costs of advertising toward the end of the year. My supplementary is to the minister responsible for multiculturalism, whose official said, in his presence, at a meeting on his estimates that the $100,000 which was being paid to Allan Gregg would not be coming out of the half-million dollar advertising budget allocated usually and by the past government for advertising in the ethnic press.
I now have a document from the Agency of Management indicating, in fact, that that $100,000 is coming out of the advertising budget, and that that frozen fund has been reduced from $500,000 to $400,000. Will the minister take steps to protect that fund which has always been used for advertising in the ethnic press and which supports the viability of the ethnic press as a voice of an important part of the Canadian people? Will he take action to ensure that the ethnic press will continue to have the support of the Government of Canada?


Yes, Mr. Speaker, the reason we do this type of research is simply so that we can get various departments of government to take a very active part in advertising in the ethnic press. That is the reason we have revised the estimate, to look at it very carefully.


Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Secretary of State for External Affairs. As a Canadian delegate to the Conference on Human Rights, National Security and Peace, held in Seoul, South Korea, three years ago with the aim of alleviating the plight of persecuted Christians held in jails there, I was distressed to learn that there have been two mass arrests in Seoul during the past four days, primarily of Christian students, outside the Christian Building and outside the YWCA. Can the minister advise what steps the Canadian government has taken, or plans to take, in order to alleviate this deplorable situation?


Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his question.


Give him a medal.


I want to tell him that in the cause of human rights-and 1 trust this will be of interest to members on the other side who seem to be making jokes about this subject-in this case we have already followed up with our ambassador in Seoul, South Korea, and have asked him to bring to the attention of the Korean authorities our concern about the way in which the human rights of these 96 people have been violated.


Mr. Speaker, my question is directed to the right hon. Prime Minister. This week the government awarded a contract for the construction of an ice-breaker to a company operating in Port Wheeler, Ontario. According to the Quebec Minister of State for Economic Development, Bernard Landry, this $60 million contract was awarded without a call for tenders. Is this true?


Mr. Speaker, 1 answer this question with great pleasure. First, I urge the hon. member to get information from a more reliable source than this one, since it is not true that this contract was awarded without a call for tenders. When the hon. member finds out how wide is the gap between the bids, he will understand why the Ontario firm got the contract.


Mr. Speaker, I would like to put a supplementary question to the Minister of Supply and Services. The government is supposed to provide $150 million to alleviate the critical situation prevailing in the shipbuilding indutry. Since $60 million out of $150 million has already been allocated, can the minister tell us whether the amount left will go to the shipyards in Quebec?


Mr. Speaker, 1 assume that hon. members are familiar with the tendering procedure. I think everybody is. The Quebec shipyards have been required to submit their tenders. I follow very closely the critical situation prevailing there and like all my colleagues, I hope that the Quebec shipyards can make acceptable tenders and I will be most happy to recommend them at that time.
November 29, 1979


Mr. Speaker, I have a question for the Secretary of State. In view of the broadcasting problems in the province of New Brunswick, specifically with respect to equipment and facilities of the CBC, and in view of the general decline in moral standards in broadcasting generally-speaking specifically of the CTV program "Pyx", prime-time family viewing-can the minister tell the House when he expects to name the new chairman of the CRTC and who that gentleman, or lady, will be?


Mr. Speaker, it is not possible at this time to indicate who the new chairman of the commission will be. I can inform the hon. member that we have had excellent co-operation from a number of the provinces, people in the industry and in the general public in terms of giving us their best suggestions so that we can make a first-rate appointment to this post.


Mr. Speaker, my question is directed to the hon. Minister of Regional Economic Expansion. In April, 1978, Ottawa and Quebec signed a $76 million agreement for tourist development in Quebec, including $11.6 million to be allocated to the lower St. Lawrence and Gaspe areas. Among those projects there was one regarding the Gaspe national park which was to take $5 million and now we hear that this project has been set back another year. Could the minister talk to his counterpart in the province of Quebec so that the funds available to the Government of Canada be used without undue delay to start work in the Gaspe national park and create jobs in that area which has such a high unemployment rate?


Mr. Speaker, 1 want to thank the hon. member who gave me notice of his question.

Also, 1 want to report to the hon. member that the administrative responsibility, as he knows, is with the Quebec ministry of recreation. I am informed, or given to understand, that the first phase of this project will begin next summer. The work will take place in the La Galine-Lac Cascapedia region. There will be a reception area, sanitary facilities, parking facilities

and a small campground commenced. Estimated preliminary costs for this phase are around $600,000. It is a beginning.


Mr. Speaker, I have a question for the Secretary of State. Considering that more than 40 per cent of our status Indians are living off reserves in large cities, that that number is growing, that these people are joined there by many non-status Indians, Metis and Inuit, that they confront many serious economic and social problems in the cities and that the most effective, sensitive and understanding services for those Indians in the cities is given by the Friendship Centres, would the minister consider exempting the budget for the Friendship Centres from the government restraint program, so they can meet these very serious commitments in the cities? And would the minister also consider, or will he make the Migrating Native Peoples Program a permanent program so that the friendship centres can plan ahead and make their work even more effective?


Mr. Speaker, I agree very much with the importance the hon. member has attached to this question. There is no doubt that we have a major responsibility, as Canadians, to the Metis and non-status Indians who are living off reserves in this country. The hon. member referred specifically to one program, the migrating native peoples program and, in particular, friendship centres.
1 had an early opportunity to meet with the national organization of friendship centres to explore their particular situation. We are very conscious of their budgetary requirements, and I can assure the hon. member that we will not make the kinds of cuts he has indicated might be projected in an area which provides a basic and important service to people who are very desperately in need.


Mr. Speaker, my question is to the Minister of Transport. Is the minister aware of representations by the city of Saint John and others regarding the status of the Saint John airport, and can he give this House some indication as to his department's intention with regard to upgrading this facility?


Mr. Speaker, I am aware of the consultations which have taken place between the Saint John representatives, particularly the Board of Trade, and Transport Canada. I would also like to

Oral Questions
inform the hon. member that representations were received by my office from officials of the community of Saint John in connection with the airport.
The airport development concept is part of a master plan study which was concluded in 1976. Because the traffic projections into the year 1985 are being re-evaluated, the whole concept is being re-examined with a view to ensuring that we can establish the best facility to meet future needs. In the meantime, there are ongoing improvements such as the building of a new maintenance centre. The matter will be evaluated. The evaluation will be concluded very shortly and we will be in a position to make an announcement shortly as to timetable and concept.


Mr. Speaker, my question is to the Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources, and it concerns the Brinex uranium mine in Labrador. The provincial government in Newfoundland has volunteered to co-ordinate environmental impact studies on the mine. However, the majority of the data is being provided by Brinex. This data is technically deficient and contradictory information has been submitted to the Atomic Energy Control Board.
As the AECB is responsible for issuing the licence to develop this mine, what will the minister do to ensure that an adequate assessment of environmental impact is carried out; and will he support the implementation of an environmental assessment review process?


Mr. Speaker, I want to inform the hon. member that the Atomic Energy Control Board, in the course of its deliberations on licensing with respect to this particular matter, will of course ensure that full and sufficient environmental impact studies are carried out, ones on which the data can be relied upon. I want to indicate to the hon. member that my information is that the process is now taking place. There will be public hearings with respect to a provincial application with regard to that mine.
So I can give the hon. member the assurance that the Atomic Energy Control Board is very much concerned, as I am, about the environmental impact studies. I hope that will satisfy the hon. member's inquiry.


Mr. Speaker, I have a question to direct to the Secretary of State for External Affairs. My question concerns the case of Mr. Richard Stanc-
[Mr. Mazankowski.j
zyk, who is a Canadian citizen and who is believed by all concerned to be jailed in Poland. Mr. Stanczyk came to Canada, by way of Germany, from his native Poland-


Order, please. Would the hon. member put his question.


Yes, Mr. Speaker. I would like to ask the minister what the government is doing to help Mr. Stanczyk return safely to Canada, since I drew this question to her attention on October 17, five weeks ago.
Hon. Flora MacDonald (Secretary of State for External
Affairs): Mr. Speaker, I would like to correct some inaccuracies in the hon. member's statement, and I appreciate the concern he has raised. I would like to tell him that Mr. Stanczyk is a dual Polish-Canadian citizen. He travelled to Poland in July of this year on his Polish passport. Having done that, he exposed himself or became liable to the charge in Poland of having departed the country illegally because he was on his Polish passport. Under such circumstances, there is very little Canadian authorities can do. People who travel on dual passports are warned beforehand about what might occur.
Nevertheless, having said that, we have asked our embassy in Warsaw to try to follow this matter up and to offer whatever services it possibly can to Mr. Stanczyk.


Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of National Health and Welfare but in his absence I will direct it to the acting minister. Considering that we know now from the report of the Economic Council of Canada that the majority of elderly Canadians are living under the poverty line, and considering also that such a situation is very drastic, is the minister in a position to advise the House and take steps to settle that problem which is becoming more and more serious?


Mr. Speaker, the Minister of National Health and Welfare is absent but I can answer that question. It might be, however, that the minister himself will give a more elaborate answer. We think the best we can do to help older persons in this country is to take steps to reduce the inflation rate. That is the primary objective of our policy. Furthermore, as I have indicated in the House on many occasions, the energy policy will include a program aimed at helping Canadians, including the elderly and the poor, meet the pressures which will result from that policy.
November 29, 1979


Mr, Speaker,
I have a supplementary question. I should like to ask the Prime Minister if this assistance designed to protect elderly persons against inflation, those who have remained below the poverty line, could reach the amount of $200 million required and recommended by the Economic Council of Canada in its recommendation No. 1, in order to bring these persons above the poverty line.


Mr. Speaker, progress has been made by the minister in his review of recommendation No. 1 of the Economic Council of Canada. In view of the present state of the economy in this country, I doubt, however, that we will be able to agree to such a proposal. Of course, if we are more successful than the former government in our fight against inflation, not only the elderly but all Canadians will benefit by it.


Mr. Speaker, I have a question for the Prime Minister. Given today's decision by President Carter to delay his recommendations on the movement of additional Alaskan oil to the lower 48 states, can the Prime Minister assure the House that he will communicate to the president that this government intends to proceed with tough legislation to minimize the risks posed to Canada by existing and new tanker traffic from Alaska?


I will certainly consult with the Minister of the Environment regarding new measures that might be contemplated by the government that should be communicated to the United States. But I can give the hon. member the asssurance, now-as I have given it before in the House-that it is the intention of this government, and my own personal intention, to be in touch with President Carter to indicate our very serious concern about the consequences to Canada, particularly to the west coast, of tanker traffic.


Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister said:
Nobody has developed a technology that can deal effectively with oil spill clean-ups-
That is a direct quotation. Can the Prime Minister indicate exactly what action is intended for the existing tanker traffic, as well as the potential increases in that traffic?


Mr. Speaker, through the Department of the Environment and through other agencies of the government we are looking for means that can improve our technical capacity
Point of Order-Mr. Baldwin
to deal with problems of that kind, should they arise. We have no new programs that we can indicate at the moment.
We believe that the most effective action we can take is to continue to make the government of the United States aware of our very real reservations regarding tanker traffic along the west coast of Canada. Naturally, if the hon. member has any specific proposals that he thinks should be considered seriously by the Government of Canada and communicated to the United States, we would be delighted to receive them.


Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of National Defence. Last July 31, a letter was sent to all married quarters informing tenants of a 50 per cent raise in rents. Could the minister tell the House whether he intends to review his position as soon as possible, considering the uncertainty suffered by the families concerned who live on military bases throughout the country?


Mr. Speaker, I am glad the hon. member asked me that question, because I can correct the misconception from which he is suffering. I remember no time when we considered increasing the rental for married quarters by 50 per cent as an average of the rent increases. Now we have put caps on the amounts that rents can be increased at various ranks and income levels, and 1 have asked the department to provide me with what I would consider a more equitable way of setting rents on married quarters.
As soon as I get the report-which I expect will be in the next day or so-I will be taking it to Treasury Board. I am not against our paying the going rates: it is simply that we have some terrible inequities in the system that I have inherited.


Mr. Speaker, I did send Your Honour notice of a question of privilege and I also notified the President of the Privy Council (Mr. Baker), but it seems to me that with a view to a more expeditious and orderly conduct of the business of the House I might well at this time reserve that question of privilege and bring this up as a point of order. It is based on the following circumstances.
On October 18, the House was good enough to pass a motion that a standing committee be established and given

November 29, 1979
Point of Order-Mr. Baldwin
terms of reference to review the terms of the present Official Secrets Act and, inter alia, that no claim of Crown privilege be allowed to limit the extent of the inquiry by the committee. On November 8 1 asked my learned friend, the President of the Privy Council, if he could proceed with the engrossing of a form of motion because it would be very sensible to put this motion together with the second reading of the bill on the freedom of information. Within a day or so I did receive from the President of the Privy Council a proposed draft motion, but it contained no reference to the question of Crown privilege.
I am told that an opinion has been received that it might not have been proper for the House to have passed the motion in the form that it did. This is something that I reject out of hand and it would form the basis of a question of privilege if 1 were to bring it up. If not, I will acknowledge that any motion which passes in this House must be subject to the statute law of Canada, but, in my opinion, when a motion of this kind has been passed, there is no inherent right of prerogative by which Crown privilege can be exercised against a committee of the House. That is something with which we can deal later.
Unfortunately I think the fault may be mine because I was unable to get in touch with my friend the President of the Privy Council to work out the details, and I assume he had his problems as well with his counterparts opposite. However, 1 understand that last night the hon. gentleman indicated that second reading of Bill C-15, the freedom of information act, would commence this evening at eight o'clock. 1 think it would be most sensible for that debate to take place contemporaneously with the debate on the question of the Official Secrets Act. The hon. member said himself that having a freedom of information act without challenging the Official Secrets Act is like flying with only one wing, and I agree with him.
So I hope that between now and eight o'clock, or certainly by no later than tomorrow, something can be worked out so that this motion can be incorporated in terms acceptable to other House leaders, and 1 think I should have some interest in it so that when we commence that debate, we can be debating both these issues at the same time. I know my hon. friend faces the inexorable tyranny of the clock and the calendar; he is learning this problem and he is not being helped too much by hon. members opposite. But I hope that it would be possible and sensible to have both the motion for second reading of the bill and the motion for the establishment of the committee debated together, so that when the committee does receive the bill, it will also receive the terms of reference. I think it would be idle to proceed with one and not the other. So I will leave it at that, reserving the right to bring up the other issue at a later date if necessary.


Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friend for his kindness in giving me n
