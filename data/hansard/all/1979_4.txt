Mr. Speaker, pursuant to Standing Order 43, I ask for the unanimous consent of the House to move a motion dealing with a matter of pressing and urgent necessity.
Since the white paper on the referendum was tabled in the Quebec National Assembly, the Canadian people have been shocked and dismayed at the incapacity of the federal government to respond to that threat to the survival of Canada. Considering the step taken by the Ontario premier and his statement supported by the Liberal leader in that province, and since the Ontario premier, given the inaction of the federal government leader, has been compelled to speak on behalf of Canada and condemn the sovereignty-association option in specific, clear and convincing terms, I move, seconded by the hon. member for Welland (Mr. Parent):
That reasonable time be allotted to the House to hold a debate on the white paper so that hon. members may direct the government towards a referendum policy which the government is idly searching for or has not the courage to adopt.


Pursuant to the provisions of Standing Order 43, the presentation of this motion requires the unanimous consent of the House. Is there unanimous consent?


Agreed.


No.


Mr. Speaker, 1 rise on a matter of urgent and pressing necessity under the provisions of Standing Order 43.
Whereas the Canadian Mental Health Association is one of our very valuable national volunteer agencies dealing with Canada's number one health problem, and since the president of this organization has noted that the restraint program carried out by the federal government means the loss of preventive treatment for the emotionally ill in their own area, I move, seconded by the hon. member for Sault Ste. Marie (Mr. Symes):
That this government stop playing Scrooge with the mentally ill of this country.

In view of the fact that the report of the Economic Council of Canada released last week states that higher-priced energy could reduce the unemployment rate because secondary workers-by which the council means primarily women-would leave the labour force, and in view of the fact that in the Speech from the Throne the government promised a full employment strategy for women, I move, seconded by the hon. member for Vancouver East (Mrs. Mitchell):
That this government move quickly to introduce programs that will effectively counteract the discriminatory effects on employment for women that the Economic Council of Canada has predicted will result from higher energy prices.

Mr. Speaker, pursuant to Standing Order 43 1 seek the unanimous consent of the House on a matter of urgent and pressing necessity.
There are in Canada over two million senior citizens, 700,000 unemployed and seven million people whose income is under $10,000 a year. Unfortunately, these poor people are represented only by back-row or second-class ministers-the Minister of National Health and Welfare, the Minister of Labour and the Minister of Employment and Immigration- who are not part of the inner cabinet which takes the main
In view of the disquieting statement contained in the report, to the effect that there is no certainty that Canadians will be free from oil supply problems this winter-including home heating oil-will the minister, in light of this most up to date reassessment of our situation, tell us what fresh steps he is contemplating to ensure that Canadians, particularly those in Atlantic Canada and Quebec, will have the certainty of oil supplies this winter? That is the issue at stake. Canadians are entitled to know with certainty that oil supplies will be provided for this winter.


Mr. Speaker, I take issue with the emphasis which the hon. member has placed on the press release of the National Energy Board. The report indicated that we would see ourselves through this winter, notwithstanding the rather unfortunate position that the previous administration left us in with respect to the supply situation in Canada.
The hon. member knows full well, as a member of that administration, that when this government came into office we

November 6, 1979
Oral Questions
were faced with depleted inventories and that we have taken some very great initiatives.


Name them.


I will, in fact, name them: there are quite a number. I assure hon. members of this House that we have taken initiatives with respect to the supply situation, and I can list them seriatim if the hon. member has the time. 1 propose to deal with these initiatives in the debate this afternoon, since the Leader of the Opposition has indicated that he wishes to discuss this matter during the course of the debate.


Mr. Speaker, I am not interested in the hon. member's apologia about his inadequacies at the moment. The National Energy Board report states quite clearly that it would be rash to predict with any certainty that Canadians will be free of oil supply problems this winter. I would draw to the minister's attention the press release containing these very words.
In light of the resignation of the government of Iran today, the political disturbances which exist in that country at this very moment, and Canada's dependency for a considerable portion of its annual supply on Iranian sources, can the minister tell the House whether the government has made any approach at the political level to authorities in Iran to ensure the continued supply of this vital oil for Canada which amounts, as I understand it, to about 100,000 barrels a day?


Mr. Speaker, I believe that the statements made by the hon. member cannot assist in terms of the outlook for next winter, in the sense that he is attempting to dramatize that which ought not to be dramatized. We in this government are taking steps with respect to policies which the opposition does not want to support but which will allow us to reach self-sufficiency and increase our supply in Canada.
As far as dealing with the government of Iran is concerned, obviously, the information has just been received. We will, of course, be in touch respecting this matter of continuing supply. We are taking steps to increase and maximize the amount of available domestic production, and we intend to continue to monitor the situation very closely. We are confident that we will be able to make it through this winter, and we will do the very best we can in terms of domestic production, domestic availability and international supply to assure that this particular objective is reached.


Mr. Speaker, the hon. minister speaks about confidence in facing the situation this winter. The National Energy Board report states that it would be rash to predict with any certainty that Canadians will be free from oil supply problems this winter.
Will the minister depart from that complacent attitude to understand the gravity of what the National Energy Board report states, and move with some speed to establish the Emergency Supplies Allocation Board? What is the minister's justification, in light of the report of the NEB and the instability in the Middle East, for not having appointed the

members of this board? If he has not done so to date, will he do it today so that somebody can get on the job, even though the minister does not seem to be on it at the moment?


Mr. Speaker, all I can say to the hon. member is that he clearly does not understand the question. He did not understand it when he was in government, and that is one of the reasons we are facing any serious prospect with respect to this winter.
The fact of the matter is that the department is setting up a support basis upon which any emergency allocation would be available. This is in place and is proceeding. As the hon. member knows, it only comes into effect when there is a crisis and the matter is reported to the House for debate under the legislation which was passed in the last Parliament. We do not have a crisis situation now. The Energy Board release indicates that the situation is manageable, but points out that there are circumstances that will cause the situation over the winter to be fragile.
I have encouraged the National Energy Board to make these reports available to the Canadian people. I think we should have this openness in terms of assessing the situation in Canada today, so that people can realize this is a commodity which should be treated with care and that there should not be the attitude that was taken previously with respect to energy supply-the stand-pat, do-nothing attitude of the previous government.


Hear, hear!


Mr. Speaker, the minister may very well say that there are no problems, but the National Energy Board has stated that it would be rash to predict with certainty that Canadians will be free of oil supply problems this winter.
In view of the fact that the provincial energy ministers thought there could be an emergency this winter, when they met last week or the week before in Calgary to discuss this problem, and undertook to provide a report to the minister, can the minister tell the House if he has received this report? If he has, what is in it, and what will he do about it?


Mr. Speaker, as usual, the hon. member's question is a week late: it has already been asked in the House by one of his colleagues.
I did receive a report from the provincial ministers. On a previous occasion, when responding to his colleague who sits not very far from him, I pointed out that we have been in close consultation with the provincial ministers. There was a suggestion that the technical advisory committee with respect to allocation be considered for reinstatement. I pointed out on previous occasions that there is some legal impediment with
November 6, 1979

respect to the creation of that advisory committee, due to possible combines implications.
We are, in fact, in close consultation on the question of allocation with the provinces and we keep them informed. We are providing them with full details of the supply situation on a monthly basis, and I have taken steps with respect to that matter to have open statements made to the Canadian public about our supply situation. The National Energy Board is now issuing a press statement on a periodic basis. These are the things that are being done by this government which the previous government refused to do.


A supplementary question, Mr. Speaker. If the minister does not answer questions, we must continue to ask them. Can the minister tell the House if he has done anything to make sure that in the event of interruption of oil imports to Quebec and Atlantic Canada this winter, that western Canadian oil can be transported to eastern Canada? That is a simple question. Forget the rhetoric and just answer the questions.


Hear, hear!


Yes, Mr. Speaker.


Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Finance. I wonder if he can reconcile two different sets of figures which have recently been released to this House. The first set is the one released today, showing that profits have gone up 51.9 per cent in the third quarter, and in some industries they have gone up as much as nine times in the third quarter.
Would the minister like to reconcile that particular figure with the figure released two weeks ago showing that the standard of living of the average Canadian was falling behind the rate of inflation? Would he like to compare the social justice of those two figures for the House?


Mr. Speaker, I should like to refer the hon. member to the report of the Economic Council of Canada-an independent body, of course, with no axe to grind. In their latest report, they show that the real inflation adjusted rates of return which they have computed on business profits dropped significantly during the 1970s as a result of inflation, that the tax system increased the real decline of business profits despite various measures introduced to counteract that, and that the decline in real profits in that period adversely affected business investment, and that it is only in 1979 that the real rate of return is being restored to previous levels.
Oral Questions
Therefore, I point out to hon. gentleman that these increases which he mentioned in percentage terms are not accurate. You have to compare them to what they are being increased from. It is this year, for the first time in five or six years, that business profits are becoming adequate; so that the aspersions he is casting on the business sector are quite unjustified, as usual.


Put some life into it.


Mr. Speaker, I thank the minister for the spontaneity of that answer.


Oh, oh!


I would like to read to the minister a statement that he made last week, not in this House but in the Empire Club. He said:
But neither have I found Canadians so unrealistic, so naive as to expect and believe that we can achieve our economic goals without real sacrifice.
Relating the two figures that I have just given the minister, and of which he is fully aware, I ask him a very simple question: In this fight against inflation which the minister has embarked upon-helped, as he is, by the "Horsemen of the Apocalypse"-can he tell us who is making the real sacrifice in our society? Is it the food companies whose profits have increased 900 per cent in the third quarter, or is it the workers whose wages have fallen behind the increase in the rate of inflation?


Mr. Speaker, the hon gentleman's questions are predictable and that is why I have here a response ready from the Economic Council of Canada.


Oh, oh!


Hear, hear!


His jeers and sneers against the business community, the risk-takers and entrepreneurs of this country are very predictable. The kinds of figures that he uses and the kinds of comparisons that he makes are equally predictable and inaccurate.


Mr. Speaker, in light of the increasing evidence that the inflation from which we are suffering is caused by administered prices both in the energy field and elsewhere, I ask the minister if it is still the policy of this government to follow the policy set out by the Prime Minister in his statement to Executive Magazine in May, 1979, that competition policy is being placed on the back burner.
In addition, 1 ask the minister why he still has the ideological attachment to his opposition to the notion of a fair prices commission which would give Canadians the sense that in the pricing mechanism there is at least an element of justice as we face hard times in the 1980s.

November 6, 1979

Mr. Speaker, we are not for a wages and incomes control policy; therefore, we are not for a partial wages or incomes or prices control policy. As far as statements by the leader of our party are concerned, I certainly pay a great deal of attention to them and I hope that the hon. gentleman does also. 1 might also add that housing starts rose last month.


Oh, oh!


Order.


The hon. member did not ask about housing starts-


Order, please. The hon. member for Algoma.


Mr. Speaker, my question is to the Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources. In light of the National Energy Board report last week, I ask the minister if, in fact, a plan has yet been formulated for the emergency allocation of petroleum supplies, and what is the reaction of the provinces to that plan?


Mr. Speaker, as I have indicated on a number of occasions in the House and earlier in my replies to the hon. member's colleagues, planning is going ahead at the official level. We have been in consultation and we are having the greatest amount of input into the process with the provinces. As I say, we have the support structure in place with respect to any pricing situation which might occur. 1 want to reiterate that it is not the opinion of the government at this time that we are in that particular position.
I want to assure the hon. member that we are looking at making it through this winter in terms of the fact that we have built up the inventory quite substantially over the course of the summer months, but while we have not attained in some instances the level of inventory that would be desirable from a perfect point of view, we are not in a bad position with respect to facing next winter. We are taking a number of initiatives to avoid the necessity of having to look at a pricing situation. 1 assure the hon. member that if that situation does occur, we will be able to move very quickly with respect to the implementation of the provisions as may be necessary.


Mr. Speaker, in light of the minister's answer, could he confirm reports that the plan will not be available until the early winter months of 1980; that in fact the provinces are quite upset that they have not been consulted and have not had an opportunity to have input into such plan?


1 cannot confirm that, Mr. Speaker. In my estimation, it is not correct.


Mr. Speaker, my question is to the Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources. Will the minister explain why Bill C-42, which was passed by this House on March 21 and accepted by the opposition at that time-now the government-has not been followed? Specifically, why has the emergency allocation supplies board as prescribed in that bill not been established?


Mr. Speaker, I point out to the hon. member that we are taking steps to bring into effect a substantial part of that legislation which may be required in the event of an emergency. As hon. members will recall, there are elements with regard to the allocations bill with which we did not agree when in opposition. I am considering bringing in some amendments to that legislation. I intend to do that as soon as the necessity arises and space is available in terms of the legislative timetable.
I assure the hon. member that in terms of our energy supply situation, we want to take initiatives that will increase the supply, that will turn the direction of the leadership which the government gives this country toward increasing supply in Canada and toward increasing alternative sources of supply. We are working in that direction in our policy, as opposed to the previous administration which the hon. member supported, which looked at everything in a crisis way.


The minister has not explained why we do not have a board. If there is an emergency supply situation-and it is very possible there will be one in eastern Canada-if the other oil companies will not do something about it, is the minister prepared to instruct PetroCan to actually make deliveries during that emergency?


Oh, oh!


Mr. Speaker, I want to advise the hon. member that we have been taking steps. Earlier this year, during the month of September, 1 asked the National Energy Board to look at the system of allocation of western crude to eastern Canada. As a result of my request, the National Energy Board approached Interprovincial Pipe Line with respect to its method of allocation.
I can tell the hon. member that on the basis of the initiative that I took, there has now become available for independents in Quebec a very substantial additional supply of crude for that part of the country and for the benefit of eastern Canada.
I had to take those initiatives as a result of the dreadful situation I was left with when we came into power-remnants of the previous government.
November 6, 1979


Mr. Speaker, the Minister of Energy, Mines and Ressources has just indicated that as a result of representations made to the National Energy Board, it is now possible for eastern independent distributors to obtain Canadian crude. This is all very well, Mr. Speaker, but according to my information, the independents who have obtained western Canada crude through the Interprovincial Pipe Line have not yet been able to find a refiner willing to refine this crude oil in Montreal. What action has the minister taken? What guarantees has he obtained, what firm commitment has he obtained from the refiners? First, did he get the assurance that they will refine the crude oil obtained by the independents and second, that they will also supply heating oil to Quebec independents?


Mr. Speaker, the hon. member will know, from his brief experience as a parliamentary secretary, that the department is in constant touch with regard to the whole question of supply. He will know that an initiative was taken by my predecessor, the energy minister in the previous government, with regard to an inquiry into the supply for independents. That particular report languished with the previous government; they apparently had to wait until after the election to release it.
I moved immediately to release the report. I distributed it to the parties involved, indicating to them in no uncertain terms that we were going to look very carefully at the whole question of allocation to the independents, and that there would be no attempt to increase the market portion by any of the refiners and terminal operators. I simply want to point out I followed that up with a telex during the month of August, in which 1 very clearly pointed out the rules of the game as far as terminal operators and refiners are concerned.


Mr. Speaker, 1 have a supplementary. I just reminded the hon. minister of some facts: first, that if the independents get crude oil from the west, it is thanks to the minister's initiative, and I commend him for it-


Order. If the hon. member has a supplementary, would he put it now?


What will the minister do now to ensure that refiners will, indeed, refine the crude oil, because crude oil cannot be used in furnaces, that is the problem? Also, what
Oral Questions
assurance can he give us that refiners will supply independents with heating oil?


Mr. Speaker, 1 have tried to point out to the hon. member, and to hon. members generally, initiatives 1 have taken with regard to making crude available to the independents in the province of Quebec. If the hon. member has any specific instance that he wants to bring to my attention-


Oh, oh!


The hon. member can talk in general terms and rhetoric; he can make an allegation. I simply say that if he wants to have a particular situation looked into, if he brings it to my attention he can rest assured that I will give it the most serious attention and do what I can to alleviate any isolated incident.


Mr. Speaker, I have a question for the Prime Minister. In view of the strong and justifiable request by veterans across Canada to have their own full-time Minister of Veterans Affairs, and because it is essential that the Canadian Armed Forces have a full-time minister, when is the Prime Minister going to split the present dual departments of National Defence and Veterans Affairs and give a full-time minister to each department?


Mr. Speaker, I think that the government, the veterans and the armed forces of this country are very fortunate to have a Minister of Veterans Affairs and Minister of National Defence as competent as the hon. Allan McKinnon who is able to carry out these dual responsibilities.


Hear, hear!


Mr. Speaker, we are not questioning the ability of the Minister of National Defence and Veterans Affairs; we are questioning the inability of the Prime Minister to appoint ministers.


Hear, hear!


A supplementary question, Mr. Speaker. Does the Prime Minister's decision to give only one minister to these two departments indicate that this is the first move to phase out the Department of Veterans Affairs; and, if not, why does the Prime Minister obviously continue treating these two very important departments, these two people-oriented departments, as minor priorities on his list?


Mr. Speaker, I noted through the last Parliament the hon. member's great concern about the inability of
990

November 6, 1979
Oral Questions
the former prime minister to appoint at least one minister whom the hon. member had in mind. He has my sympathy on that.
The hon. member asked a particular question about the future of the Department of Veterans Affairs. I can assure him, without any equivocation or qualification, that we intend to retain an independent and strong Department of Veterans Affairs as an independent unit in the Government of Canada.


Hear, hear!


Mr. Speaker, 1 have a question for the Secretary of State for External Affairs. Can the minister confirm to the House that owing to inflation there will be, in real terms, a decrease in Canada's foreign aid expenditures this coming year? If so, can she indicate to the House why she continues to speak at international forums about the necessity of providing increased aid to those in need, while at the same time cutting back the real value of that aid?


Mr. Speaker, the actual figures for our aid program will become known to the House and to the country when the estimates are tabled next year. I cannot give the hon. member that information at this time. I can say, however, that there will be no fewer dollars paid out in aid to developing countries in the next year than there has been this year.
As well, I would like to emphasize that we have made recent payments to foreign countries such as Bangladesh through a new program of food aid totalling some $40 million, and there have been new pledges to the Caribbean of some $10 million. Then just recently there was a pledge of some $15 million to Kampuchea to help meet humanitarian needs in that part of the world.


1 realize there will be no fewer dollars. The point is that with inflation running at 9 per cent, and aid increasing at-probably-only 2 per cent, the real value of our aid is declining.
Can the minister give us an equal assurance that the increase in aid to Kampuchea, of which we all approve, will not mean a decrease in the other foreign aid which is provided, including that provided through non-governmental organizations?


I can assure the hon. member that the attention and the importance we shall be attaching to the work of the non-governmental organizations will increase, not decrease, in the years ahead.


Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of State for the Treasury Board. Can the hon. gentlemen indicate, generally, what his responsibilities are-


Oh, oh!


-and, specifically, whether they include investigation of improper use of social insurance numbers? If so, I want to ask him what measures he is taking to prevent the unnecessary use of these numbers by government and by business.


Hear, hear!


am tempted to respond to the first part of my hon. friend's question by saying the information is classified. The fact is, the Prime Minister has asked me to take responsibility within the government for matters relating to bilingualism within the public service, as well as privacy and compliance with part IV of the Human Rights Act. I will be tabling legislation dealing with the Crown corporations' omnibus bill, and responding on behalf of the government with regard to both regulatory reform and the Lambert commission experts.
As to the second part of the question, 1 do, indeed, have responsibility for developing a policy on behalf of the government with respect to social insurance numbers. I expect that within a matter of a few days I shall be able to announce to the House the fact that the government will be following a policy very different from that of the previous government: we will be rolling back the use of social insurance numbers in the federal government to a very minimum-


Hear, hear!

Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Supply and Services. In light of the meeting held yesterday in Montreal during which several federal and provincial ministers had discussions about projects to be undertaken in the province of Quebec and in light of the comments we heard last night from provincial ministers as well
November 6, 1979

as from Senator de Cotret, could the minister tell us whether he intends to announce immediately or very soon the decisions that his government will make as to the sums of money which will be invested in projects that have already been announced in Quebec and 1 am, of course, referring more particularly to the proposed fiscal data study centre in Jonquiere?


Mr. Speaker, I will be happy to answer the hon. member's question. That meeting was excellent. I would not venture to say that the Quebec ministers told us what their priorities were, but they told us about their projects in general. We listened to them as equals-


As equals!


Yes, we listened to them as equals. The discussion was quite fruitful for both sides. That is something new for you, but not for us. The discussion left a good impression. Now, to give a very clear answer, the projects in question have not yet been announced, but they will be very soon, as the hon. member said.


Mr. Speaker, I have a supplementary question. The minister is very satisfied with the results of the meeting, but according to some statements he made, his counterpart Mr. Landry, was a lot less satisfied with those results. He has nothing whatsoever against being consulted or against participating in a dialogue, but what he is mostly interested in is knowing the government's decision. Is the minister going to wait several months again before announcing his decision? Could the Minister of Public Works, who is smiling, go ahead soon, if he is authorized to do so, of course, and erect those buildings, because they will be needed?


Mr. Speaker, I would like to reassure the hon. member as well as Mr. Landry. It will not take several months.
Oral Questions
Hon. James A. McGrath (Minister of Fisheries and
Oceans): Yes, Mr. Speaker, we had a very useful and co-operative meeting with the government of Newfoundland. 1 indicated it was our policy that primacy, or first call on the Hamilton Bank or northern cod stocks should be for the Newfoundland inshore fishermen, recognizing, of course, the importance of that cod stock to the maintenance of the northeast coast inshore fishery.


My supplementary is to the Prime Minister. We know the Prime Minister had a meeting with the Premier of Newfoundland on the question of the jurisdiction of offshore oil and gas and we are aware of the outcome of those discussions.
Can the right hon. gentleman tell us whether he has taken part in similar discussions with respect to jurisdiction over fish stocks, and can he tell us whether his position with regard to fish stocks would be the same as his position with respect to jurisdiction over offshore oil and gas?


Mr. Speaker, I have not had a meeting with the Premier of Newfoundland to discuss the question raised by the hon. member, although the Minister of Fisheries has been meeting with Newfoundland officials, as he has just said, to discuss ways in which federal and provincial governments can co-operate to strengthen and develop the fisheries serving Newfoundland and Canada.

Mr. Speaker, my question is directed to the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans. The hon. gentleman met yesterday with the Premier of Newfoundland and among other subjects discussed was the allocation of cod quotas on the Hamilton Bank.
Can the minister confirm that the position of the Premier of Newfoundland was that cod quotas be reserved exclusively for the inshore fishermen of Newfoundland and Labrador? Can the hon. gentleman tell us his response to that submission, and whether any agreement was reached between the premier and himself at the conclusion of their meeting? Can he report to the House the results of that meeting yesterday?


Mr. Speaker, my question is directed to the right hon. Prime Minister.
Late yesterday I sent him a letter concerning two very important matters. One has to do with the supply of gas and heating oil to the eastern provinces, the other with the supply and the securing of supply quotas to independent distributors. I have waited until the end of the question period. Mr. Speaker, 1 would like to ask the right hon. Prime Minister whether he has received my letter, whether he has read it and, third, whether he intends to take action on it today.


Mr. Speaker, I did receive the hon. member's letter. I even read it. I intend to speak later today during the debate which is to be opened by the Leader of the Opposition and which relates to the questions raised by the hon. member.

In view of the fact that the largest plywood manufacturer in Canada, Weldwood Limited, has just announced the lay-off of 700 people, stating that the major reason for the lay-offs is the government's high interest policy which is having a disastrous effect on the Canadian housing market, can the Prime Minister advise the House what action he intends to take to get these people back to their jobs?


I shall certainly be prepared to have officials of my government meet with representatives of the company and of the workers to see if there is some action we can take which will get them back working productively.


Hear, hear!


That is a rather unfortunate answer to a serious question.


Oh, oh!


The manager of the plant said this morning the government's high interest rate policy was like a drug which cured the disease but killed the patient. What message can 1 take from the Prime Minister to the 700 workers and their families who are now without income as a direct result of this government's high interest rate policy?


Mr. Speaker, the hon. member can take back to the 700 workers, in whose name he presumes to speak, the fact that the Government of Canada and the Prime Minister of Canada are concerned about their situation. We are prepared to do what we can to try to help remedy their situation. 1 would suggest to the hon. member, and to the workers, through him, that they might find it more productive to get in touch with me directly.


Arrogance.


No respect for Parliament.


Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of State for International Trade.

In view of the announcement, still to be debated in the House, of the creation of a committee to look over the whole question of nuclear energy, including the export of nuclear reactors, I am concerned about the possible effects of that announcement and of the creation of that committee on the Canadian marketing efforts to sell nuclear reactors so important to our balance of trade.
Can the House be assured that the promotional efforts of the Canadian government are continuing now, and have instructions to that effect been given to various departments involved in it, such as the Department of Industry, Trade and Commerce, Atomic Energy of Canada Limited and the Department of External Affairs, particularly through the Secretary of State for External Affairs and trade commissioners, or are we going to witness another hiatus of the type we had on the Jerusalem issue?


Mr. Speaker, the question of the export of nuclear equipment is very important to this country. 1 believe that in the Candu system we have a very important export product. Last week, I met with Mr. Donnelly, president of AECL, as well as the Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources. That is the second meeting we have had in the last couple of weeks to discuss this very point. I would expect that this series of meetings will be continuing in order to develop broader trade packages which co-ordinate with our nuclear export activities and to follow through in the direction in which the member is suggesting we should go.


Mr. Speaker, I gather that the minister has the support of all his colleagues in the cabinet for that effort. I should like to hear it very strongly and publicly.
In view of the importance of the sale of a Candu reactor to Japan, in particular-something which is very important for the future of the program-is the minister ready to go to Japan, possibly taking some of his colleagues, such as the Secretary of State for External Affairs, to promote the sale of a nuclear reactor to Japan as soon as the government of that country is formed?


Mr. Speaker, Japan was one of the countries we discussed. 1 have also been in touch with our embassy. Embassy officials are keeping us in close touch with the way discussions are going in Japan. The hon. member must be aware of the fact that there are some differences of opinion in Japan as to which way to go. We are following this very closely, and if it is appropriate for me to visit Japan in furtherance of our export activities, I will do so.


Mr. Speaker, my question is to the same minister. In answer to my colleague's question of October 24 with regard to trade with Mexico, the minister said two months ago that a committee had been set up. That was on October 24. What was the study carried out, when is the
November 6, 1979

report going to be tabled, and can we expect from this government some interest in AECL?


Mr. Speaker, when I made reference to that study, I believe I also said that the study would take about six months to complete. The study is continuing, and we expect that following its completion we will have something to announce.


Mr. Speaker, Canadians have fresh in their minds the bungling of the Conservative government of this industry back in the 1950s, when Canadians were becoming increasingly worried about the fate of our Candu program. I want to know if we can get an answer before six months elapse.


Mr. Speaker, to repeat my answer, we will not have an answer before that six months period is up. These contracts on Candu reactors are very complex. They have to be co-ordinated with the countries involved. The study is going on with people in Canada as well as with Mexican officials to see how we will be able to co-operate in the export of that product.


1 have a question, Mr. Speaker. As a result of the U.S. legislation on convention expenses, the Canadian hotel trade has lost almost $100 million in revenue. What progress is being made in the negotiations with the U.S. government in this regard, and what kind of representations does the Canadian government intend to make to the American government so that they will change their legislation?


Mr. Speaker, this question of convention business coming to Canada from the United States, which has been affected by the legislation concerned, is of very real interest to us.
We have had discussions at the official level with the United States, and these are ongoing. I believe that the Secretary of State for External Affairs has had discussions on this matter with the Secretary of State of the United States. They are aware of our concern and they are also aware of the concern we have for the linkage they have made between convention centres and border broadcasting. We are following this question very closely, and I hope there will be a satisfactory conclusion in the not too distant future.


Mr. Speaker, my question is directed to the Prime Minister. Does he intend to discuss this specific matter with President Carter during his forthcoming visit to Ottawa and what priority does he, personally, give to this issue?
Oral Questions


Mr. Speaker, indeed I intend to raise this matter with President Carter as it is one of our priorities.


Mr. Speaker, I should like to direct a question to the Minister of State for International Trade. In view of recent figures indicating that there is a $2.9 billion trade deficit in the auto trade, in view of the fact that the Automotive Parts Manufacturers' Association has recommended to the government their need in particular for further investment and the need for a special fund for research and development and retooling and, further, that the government should seriously consider discussing the whole question of the auto pact and whether it should be opened up for renegotiation with the President of the United States-that being also a specific recommendation of the government- would the minister please tell us what he intends to do about these recommendations?


Mr. Speaker, the brief to which the hon. member referred was presented to my colleague, the Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce, about two weeks ago. We had a good discussion with the representatives at the time. Since then I have discussed it with other members of the association. It is currently under review. This is an important issue, particularly in the area of trade.


What about the present?


The hon. member might address that question to the Prime Minister.


Mr Speaker, I address my supplementary question to the Prime Minister who, 1 believe, heard my first question to the Minister of State for International Trade. Part of that question was whether this whole matter, serious as it is, will be discussed with the President of the United States this Friday by the Prime Minister.
1 would also ask, in conjunction with that, whether the Prime Minister would indicate to the House whether he will discuss with the President of the U.S. the whole question of aid to Chrysler. As he knows, Mr. Miller, in the United States, has indicated they are giving loan guarantees of, I believe, $1.5 billion to Chrysler in that country. Mr. Miller indicated that perhaps similar action should be contemplated by other jurisdictions, particularly in view of the fact that the Chrysler Corporation, 1 believe, lost some $40 million this year and some $80 million last year. Would the Prime Minister indicate

whether he is prepared to discuss that matter also with the President on Friday?


I am going to raise with the President discussions relating to the auto pact, and I have no intention, today, to raise questions relating to Chrysler.

Mr. Speaker, my question is directed to the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans. The minister is aware of the difficulties maritime fishermen have had in selling squid. Also, he is aware a representation was made earlier this summer for over-the-side sales and that the request was refused on the basis that processors had guaranteed that those squid could be purchased and processed in Canada.
Can the minister give some guarantee to maritime fishermen that he will reconsider the decision of his department to refuse over-the-side sales for maritime fishermen in regard to the dumping and the waste of that fishery resource?


Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is referring to a situation recently in Nova Scotia in the area of St. George's Bay, where there was a request to sell over-the-side to Japanese freezer-trawlers. At the time the request came in, Canadian processors were buying and continued to buy from Canadian fishermen.


At 12 cents a pound.


Also, the hon. member should bear in mind that there is a very difficult market situation at the present time as a result of an oversupply situation, resulting from an oversupply in Canada and an oversupply in the other squid fisheries of the world off the coasts of Japan and New Zealand. As a consequence, Canadian freezers are bulging at this time with squid which cannot be sold. Consequently, it is not our policy to license any more foreign over-the-side sales as long as that situation prevails.


Mr. Speaker, is the minister aware that the same concern exists in Newfoundland and that Newfoundland fishermen will want some guarantees, some policy statement from the minister as to what might happen to their squid and mackerel fisheries next season?


Yes, Mr. Speaker, I am aware of that concern. I can assure the hon. member and the House that government policy in this regard will be announced in due course.


On a lighter note, Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Agriculture. According to a press report last week, Alexander G. Schauss, director of the Institute for Biological Research at City College, Tacoma, Washington, stated that studies of juvenile delinquents have shown an apparent relationship between heavy milk drinking and antisocial behaviour.
Such statements should not go unchallenged; therefore, I should like to ask the Minister of Agriculture if he would consult with his colleague, the Minister of National Health and Welfare, to refute publicly such irresponsible statements which, if left unchallenged, could do irreparable damage to dairy farmers and the dairy industry.


Mr. Speaker, in response to the question of the hon. member, 1 regret that I have not had an opportunity to re
