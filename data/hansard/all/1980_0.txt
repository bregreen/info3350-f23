Madam Speaker, I rise under the provisions of Standing Order 43 on a matter of urgent and pressing necessity. Terry Fox, through his "Marathon of Hope", has joined the ranks of our oustanding Canadian heroes in the fight against cancer. To those people suffering from this dreaded disease in Canada and all over the world, it is Terry Fox who has given them hope through his courage and determination. Most of us have lost someone dear to cancer, just as I lost my dad. Terry Fox has given special pride to Canadians and has touched the hearts of us all.
In recognition of Terry Fox and the "Marathon of Hope" in the fight against cancer, I move, seconded by the hon. member for St. Catharines (Mr. Reid):
That this House extend to Terry Fox hearty congratulations and thanks on behalf of all Canadians, and furthermore, that the government strike a suitable stamp to commemorate Terry Fox and the "Marathon of Hope".


Hear, hear!


This motion requires the unanimous consent of the House. Is there unanimous consent?


Agreed.


No.


Madam Speaker, I rise under the provisions of Standing Order 43 on a matter of urgent and pressing necessity. In view of the fact that the Government of Canada has lacked a functioning Minister of the Environment for several months now as the nominal incumbent devotes all his time to constitutional matters, I
move, seconded by the hon. member for Esquimalt-Saanich (Mr. Munro):
That this House urge the Prime Minister to appoint a new Minister of the Environment who can be counted on to deal full time with Canada's serious environmental problems, such as acid rain.


Such a motion requires the unanimous consent of the House. Is there unanimous consent?


Agreed.


No.


Madam Speaker, I rise on a matter of urgent and pressing necessity under the authority of Standing Order 43. Whereas the people of Alberta are completely disgusted with the way the Canada Post Office is operating, if indeed it can be called an operation; whereas people are paying dearly for damaged parcels and lost letters totalling thousands of dollars; whereas it takes days, from nine to 17 days, for a letter to go from Edmonton to Strathmore, with most of that time being consumed in the Calgary regional post office, and 21 days for a letter to go from Humboldt, Saskatchewan to Strathmore, Alberta-it only takes eight hours to drive this distance; whereas large companies are completely disgusted with the postal service and are using alternative methods of mail delivery, which hurts the smaller post offices which are doing a good job locally and denies the Post Office badly needed revenue; and whereas the postal service is now viewed by many Canadians as an inept, bungling department of national disgrace; therefore I move, seconded by the hon. member for Calgary East (Mr. Kushner):
That the House of Commons urge the government to conduct a full scale inquiry for the purpose of pinpointing the reasons for the poor postal service in Canada, ascertaining who or what is responsible for the damaged parcels and thefts, and recommending the changes necessary to restore to Canada reasonable postal service.


Such a motion requires the unanimous consent of the House. Is there unanimous consent?


Agreed.


No.

Madam Speaker, I rise under the provisions of Standing Order 43 and ask for the unanimous consent of the House to discuss a motion relating to a matter of urgent and pressing necessity.
Given the fact that the government has refused to negotiate in good faith with the translators and interpreters working for the federal public service by rejecting the recommendations of the conciliation board, I move, seconded by the hon. member for Winnipeg-Birds Hill (Mr. Blaikie):
That the House request the government to accept as soon as possible the recommendations of the conciliation board, including the principles of indexation and maternity leave.


The House has heard the hon. member's motion. Pursuant to Standing Order 43, this motion requires the unanimous consent of the House. Is there unanimous consent?

Madam Speaker, I rise under the provisions of Standing Order 43. Because of its excess borrowing the Government of Canada is now paying 11.5 per cent on 90-day treasury bills and in excess of 12.25 per cent on 180-day treasury bills. The government's excess demand for money will continue to push interest rates in Canada higher and higher. The government has pegged the Canada Savings Bonds rate this year at 10.5 per cent.
In view of the fact Canada Savings Bonds are sold as having a good rate of return, as being an investment in Canada, and marketed as top quality securities to the ordinary people of Canada, I move, seconded by the hon. member for Fraser Valley West (Mr. Wenman):
That this House do direct the Minister of Finance to pay to those holding Canada Savings Bonds an interest rate at least equal to the 90-day treasury rate paid to the big boys in the marketplace.


Such a motion requires the unanimous consent of the House. Is there unanimous consent?


Agreed.


No.


Madam Speaker, 1 rise under the provisions of Standing Order 43 on a matter of urgent and pressing necessity. In view of the fact the Canadian government inland elevator at Moose Jaw has been delisted as a delivery point for rapeseed futures contracts; in view of the fact that this delisting would indicate an intention on the part of the government to shut down the facilities if the elevator is not sold, despite the fact the elevator has been operating at a profit; and in view of the fact that a shutdown of the facilities would affect approximately 50 employees and their families, I move, seconded by the hon. member for Swift Current-Maple Creek (Mr. Hamilton):
That the Minister of Agriculture seriously consider relisting the elevator as a delivery point for rapeseed futures contracts and spending the necessary funds to rehabilitate the electrical system, in order that the elevator may continue to play an important part in the grain handling system in western Canada.


Such a motion requires the unanimous consent of the House. Is there unanimous consent?


Agreed.


No.


Madam Speaker, I rise under the provisions of Standing Order 43. Whereas the lay-offs of working men and women at a rate of 1,000 per day makes a mockery of the fundamental principle that labour is not a commodity, and whereas the basic economic rights, living standards and futures of hundreds of thousands of Canadians are threatened by runaway employers and government neglect, I move, seconded by the hon. member for Vancouver East (Mrs. Mitchell):
That this government be condemned for its indifference to the plight of Canada's unemployed, for economic and social policies that promote unemployment and offer no protection to those laid off, and for failing to promote policies of full employment, decent pensions and employer obligation to Canada's employees.


Such a motion requires the unanimous consent of the House. Is there unanimous consent?

Madam Speaker, I rise under the provisions of Standing Order 43 on a matter of urgent and pressing necessity. Whereas an eminent Canadian, the Honourable Sterling Lyon, the Premier of Manitoba, last evening appeared on a CBC public affairs program, "The Watson Report", and whereas notwithstanding the barrage of questions this same Canadian was able to plead eloquently for a strong federal government, endowed with the necessary tools to deal with unemployment and inflation, 1 move, seconded by the hon. member for Restigouche (Mr. Harquail):
That this House applauds the Honourable Sterling Lyon, Premier of Manitoba, for his tardy but welcome endorsement for a vigorous federal government.


Such a motion requires the unanimous consent of the House. Is there unanimous consent?


Agreed.


Madam Speaker, this is a matter which, of course, allows debate in the House of Commons under Standing Order 43. While I would not want to delay unduly the proceedings of the House, I think 1 can say with absolute confidence and certainty, knowing the views of the Premier of Manitoba and sharing his confidence, that the Premier of Manitoba would not only want the Government of Canada to have the tools to deal with unemployment and inflation; he would want, as we on this side of the House of Commons want, this government to begin to use those tools to deal with inflation and to deal with unemployment in this country.


Hear, hear!


Indeed, Madam Speaker, we are convinced that the Premier of Manitoba, like the great majority of Canadians, is shocked and chagrined that to this point, some seven months into their mandate, the Government of Canada has not yet even introduced a budget.


Hear, hear!


Order, please. The right hon. member is right, this motion is debatable, but I am afraid that, in accordance with our Standing Orders, I must interrupt the debate at 2.15 for oral questions.
Oral Questions


Madam Speaker, my question will be to the Prime Minister and it touches on the strike activity that is now rampant in the country, with airports closed down, some reopening, and the Post Office disrupted. 1 note that the Public Service Alliance of Canada has asked that their workers designated essential to the safety and security of the country to return to work to perform the full scope of their duties. Would the Prime Minister indicate whether, with this welcome news as it is, any assurance was given to the Public Service Alliance of Canada that there would be no repercussions with respect to those that have acted illegally so far as a result of the various strike activities which have been taking place?


Madam Speaker, the answer with respect to the current negotiations, as I understand it, is that the matter is presently under discussion. No such assurance has been given.


I am sorry to hear that something as significant as that is still being left as a matter of discussion. Madam Speaker. Let me direct my next question to the Minister of Transport. In view of the fact that eight firefighters at Malton and two or three firefighters at certain other airports have been able to shut down their respective airports, and in view of the fact that on September 30 the President of the Treasury Board indicated that departments had been instructed to take firm and consistent disciplinary action in the case of any employees engaging in illegal strike activity, would the Minister of Transport indicate what disciplinary action his department has taken against these firefighters who now claim they were only on a two-day coffee break?


Madam Speaker, we have taken this disciplinary action. We have tried to take a moderate approach so as not to aggravate the situation unnecessarily, but it has not been very fruitful. 1 am the first one to recognize that fact. The difficulty, as my friend knows from previous experience, is due to the number of issues at hand. When it is not reclassification, it is higher wages; and when it is not higher wages, it is a greater number of controllers and so on.


You are negotiating with your feet.


Oh, oh!

October 7, 1980
Oral Questions


We have taken disciplinary action and we will continue to do so. If we have to do more than what we have done, then we will do that also.


Madam Speaker, would the Minister of Transport indicate specifically, though, what action he has taken?


Madam Speaker, obviously, we deprive the controllers of their pay for the day on which they leave their jobs. We penalize them by imposing another day of suspension, we add a letter of reprimand to their file and that sort of thing. If they repeat the offence we escalate the combination.


You will take away their coffee.


If they repeat the action the suspension goes from one day to three days. That is the normal practice.


Madam Speaker, I would like to direct a supplementary question to the Right Hon. Prime Minister. This morning a judge of the Federal Court described the situation by saying: "The existing situation is perilously close to anarchy".
There have been outbreaks of violence on the picket lines this morning both in St. John's, Newfoundland and in Ottawa. There are indications that the situation is growing more militant every day. My question to the Prime Minister-and I pose it in the aftermath of the bungling of the President of the Treasury Board-is: What steps is he taking on behalf of the government to protect the national interest and to ensure that Canadians have access to essential services?


Madam Speaker, as the Deputy Prime Minister just answered a moment ago, the negotiations are presently going on and 1 would not want to intervene in them.


Madam Speaker, perhaps I could ask the Minister of National Health and Welfare a question in light of a statement made by the President of the Treasury Board in which he indicated that departments have been asked to prepare their own plans to ensure the maintenance of the highest level of service to the public. Given the chance that there will be a disruption in postal services, and there is already an indication that this is happening across the country, what steps is she taking presently or what contingency plan does she have to ensure that essential social service payments will get to the recipients in this country?
[ Translation]


Madam Speaker, 1 am pleased to assure all Canadians that so far we have every reason to believe that they will
receive their cheques on time at home. Several families will receive their family allowances cheques about one week before the usual date which is in the third week of the month. The usual date is between the 18 and 21 of each month. The cheques for the Canada Pension Plan have almost been completely written. The cheques for the old age security pension as well as most adjustments are also under control. The mechanism for the delivery of the cheques is the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister of Supply and Services; to date we have no reason to alarm Canadians, and I think that as usual we shall have the co-operation of all people concerned.


Madam Speaker, I pose a similar question to the Minister of Manpower and Immigration, who is responsible for the Unemployment Insurance Commission. In light of the present situation and the potential it has for disruption of mail services, what contingency plans has the minister taken to ensure that unemployment insurance cheques will be sent out to their recipients?


Madam Speaker, in most parts of the country there is a complete and continuing operation of the unemployment insurance program. There are some regions, however, where there have been disruptions in service which were primarily due to the absence of clerks who were designated to stay on and perform their duties. We certainly believe that the measures taken by the government will have a corrective influence on that situation. We hope to maintain as much of the service as possible, so long as those people who are supposed to work do their work.


Madam Speaker, my question is for the Minister of National Health and Welfare. Former Justice Hall has rightly observed in the recently released "Health Services Review" that extra billing by doctors, if allowed to continue, will eventually destroy medicare and result in a two tier-system of health care in Canada.
Can the minister tell the House at this time when she intends to bring in legislation outlawing extra billing by doctors by revising the Medical Care Act to provide that extra billing by physicians inhibits reasonable access to services and is contrary to the intent and purpose of the Medical Care Act?


Madam Speaker, I am tabling the Hall report later
October 7, 1980

today in the House; it was made public a month ago. Since that time we have had the federal-provincial meeting of health ministers at which 1 confirmed, and 1 would like to repeat it today, that I will explore that recommendation made by Mr. Justice Hall to the federal government. However, that recommendation includes also the concept of binding arbitration. Would the New Democratic Party make it clear if they are ready to accept, and is the government of Saskatchewan, for instance, ready to accept, binding arbitration as well as the ban on extra billing? That is only one of the problems with which we are faced today.
The purpose and objective that has always been ours is the strengthening of the medicare system of Canada for all Canadians. Right now I have chosen the route of consultation with all interested parties, because it is surely essential if we want to put together the very conflicting interests of the key health professionals as well as the provincial governments, who on that subject have totally diverse opinions.


Madam Speaker, may I say that I am not here as a spokesman for the government of Saskatchewan, but I can say that I know that province is interested in the outlawing of extra billing.
The minister says that she wants to consult more. For a government obsessed with timetables, the timetable for saving medicare seems to be pretty loose. Can the minister say why she is breaking her campaign promises to the Canadian people by not acting swiftly to stem the erosion of medicare now that she has the Hall report to support her?


Madam Speaker, the report was made public upon its receipt on September 3. I immediately invited my counterparts to a meeting on the September 15 and 16. They thought that was too fast and the meeting finally took place at their request on September 29, I think it was, in Winnipeg. That was a week ago Monday. The ten provinces told me that they reject binding arbitration.
The morning after, I received the Canadian Medical Association for a long meeting, the first of a series of meetings. They reject extra billing. So the two parties are in total opposition. If the hon. member read the Hall report in depth he will know that it is very well said that the two must go together, that there is, on the one hand, a mechanism to make sure that the doctors get fair process of negotiation and, at the same time, that Canadians will not see their medicare system eroded by breach of the agreement, namely extra billing.


Madam Speaker, my final supplementary question is to ask the minister again when she is going to start some initiative by the federal government and when she is going to take the responsibility that is rightly hers for the health care system in Canada and stop being intimidated by the medical associations in the provinces. When is she going to take some action and live up to some of the promises that she has been so accustomed to making over the last few years?


Madam Speaker, it may well be that there are players in the medicare system who want to feed and nurture a
Oral Questions
confrontation between the parties. For a few months now we have been repeating and repeating that sooner or later the parties must come together and settle it. Mr. Hall himself said very clearly-and we are left with that dilemma and all members of the House have to take a stand on that-that, for example, the interruption of block funding by withholding the monthly payment-in other words, by applying the act the way it was passed by this Parliament-is disruptive to services. On the other hand, he also recommends that provinces ban extra billing and adopt binding arbitration as the mechanism to give fair process to the doctors and to us to amend the Medical Care Act. I cannot change our act and impose binding arbitration if the ten provinces reject it. We will have other consultations in order to come to an agreement. My next meeting of ministers is in February.


Madam Speaker, I have a supplementary question for the Minister of National Health and Welfare which concerns the same matter. The report from Mr. Justice Hall indicated that there ought to be compulsory arbitration. My understanding is that the minister has publicly rejected that as a recommendation. It seems to me that she has a responsibility to put something in its place. What has she offered?


I am very pleased, Madam Speaker, to have an opportunity to correct the statement made by my colleague. At the Winnipeg conference, in a very short statement at the end of the meeting to my counterparts as well as to the press, I said that I had accepted that recommendation of Mr. Justice Hall; that I would explore the timing and the way it could be done; that I would not implement it unless full consultations had taken place with all interested parties. I still have to see representatives of the nurses of Canada, of the hospital administrators, of the coalition for health, etc.
I would not propose an amendment, because I am not in a position to do so, including the addition of the words "binding arbitration". The objective described by Mr. Justice Hall, namely that there would be a mechanism giving fair process of negotiations to the doctors, would be used instead of the words "binding arbitration".


Madam Speaker, I had assumed that the minister had rejected compulsory arbitration. She now seems to be not saying that. Would the minister confirm to the House whether or not she accepts or rejects the principle of compulsory arbitration for professional medical fees, as outlined in the recommendation of Emmett Hall?


Madam Speaker, I wish I could find the exact words of the recommendation, which sets out what we should be doing. Mr. Justice Hall recommends to the federal government an amendment to the Medical Care Act in order to ban extra billing. Mr. Justice Hall recommends the provinces ban

October 7, 1980
Oral Questions
extra billing and provide for binding arbitration. Who are we to impose on the provinces who will be bound by binding arbitration?


Oh, oh!


Just like the constitution.


Madam Speaker, my question is to the Acting Secretary of State for External Affairs. In view of the fact that the Quebec government has decided to give humanitarian aid to the Palestine Liberation Organization, according to recent press reports, and in view of the fact that aid from a provincial government to one of the antagonists in the mid-East conflict could be construed as support for one side over the other, thereby prejudicing the international position of the Canadian government, will the acting minister advise the Secretary of State for External Affairs to conduct an investigation into this matter and, if necessary, to stop this aid or have the federal government see that both sides receive equal amounts of assistance?
[ Translation]


Madam Speaker, the federal government is not aware that the government of Quebec has committed itself to provide humanitarian aid to the Palestine Liberation Organization. But we are going to check those facts. However, I can tell the House that the federal government does not intend to provide any humanitarian aid to the PLO. Our humanitarian assistance to the people of Palestine is transferred through the Relief and Works Agency of the United Nations for Palestine Refugees, an agency to which Canada is one of the main contributors. Madam Speaker, our contribution to that agency was roughly $5 million last year and it will amount to $5.7 million for the current year.


Madam Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Finance. On August 1 the Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources, who is going to share budget night, we understand, with the Minister of Finance-there is going to be a joint presentation, the "Mutt and Jeff show"-


The "Marc and Allan show".


-said this: "At the retail level, we believe it is only fair that consumers bear the costs now borne by the taxpayer to subsidize imported oil while we are still importing oil." Since the cost of that subsidy this year is about $4 billion, and since the cost of gasoline since March 1-since this government took office-has risen 15 cents a gallon-


Oh, oh!


I do not know what that is in litres, but it is quite a bit even in litres-will the Minister of Finance tell us how the government proposes to pass on this $4 billion cost to the Canadian consumer, and how many cents a gallon or a litre will that come to for the Canadian consumer when it is passed on this year as this principle of the minister of energy is carried out?


Madam Speaker, 1 think the hon. member knows that we do have in place an oil import compensation program that has the effect of assisting consumers of imported oil. When that program is changed it will be announced in the House and the hon. member will be assisted by all of us in reaching whatever calculations he requires at that time.


Madam Speaker, I just gave the quotation where the policy was changed on August 1 by the minister in this very detailed statement. It is just the mere details we do not know yet, namely, how the $4 billion is going to be collected from the public.
The Prime Minister on January 12, in Toronto, before he was Prime Minister-in his interlude-said that he was going to make the tax system more equitable. In order to make it more equitable, will the minister explain to the House how he is going to pass on this $4 billion to the consumer? Will it be by deindexing the personal income tax, or by a tax at the refinery gate level that will increase the price of gasoline, transportation fuels, heating fuels, petrochemical products, and all the rest of the products made from oil, or will he eliminate the sales tax and put it up another 3 per cent and reverse what happened in November, 1978? How is he going to carry out this equitable tax principle of the Prime Minister's and pass on this $4 billion?


Madam Speaker, I am a bit surprised at the series of questions which the hon. member is asking this afternoon; whether we intend to deindex; whether we intend to have a refinery tax; whether we intend to increase the sales tax.


Surprise us with an answer.


I just ask him to wait and he will find out the answers in one shot before the end of the month.


Oh, oh!


Some shot!


Hear, hear!
October 7, 1980


Madam Speaker, the question is: Will we survive the shot?
I have a question for the Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources. According to a survey by the Canadian Association of Oil Drilling Contractors, the failure of this government to reach an oil pricing agreement and the continuing threats to impose gas export and other taxes have led Canadian oil companies to reduce their planned exploration budgets for next year by about one-third, or $2 billion, and to divert this money to the U.S. Is the minister aware of this situation; is he concerned about it; has he expressed his concern to his cabinet colleagues; has he planned some action, or is he prepared to believe the propaganda in his energy advertising that the energy future is secure regardless of government action or inaction?


Madam Speaker, I was reading very recently a submission by Dome Petroleum to a board of investigation in British Columbia which indicated that in spite of the fact there was no agreement on pricing this year, drilling in western Canada has increased by between 15 and 19 per cent over the year when the Tories were in office.


Oh, oh!


1 look at what has happened in the course of this current year and 1 am confident that when our decisions are announced, companies in the oil and gas field in Canada, particularly Canadian companies, will be very happy with what we are going to produce.


I gather that means you are not aware of what is happening. My supplementary deals with the government's proposed gas export tax which, in addition to being discriminatory, represents in the case of British Columbia a direct tax on the B.C. treasury and, in the case of Alberta, a tax on the industry which will drive many junior Canadian gas producers, if not into bankruptcy, at least into forced sales.
Is the minister concerned about the consequences of this proposed export tax? Has he expressed his concerns to his colleague the Minister of Finance, who is preparing this shot for Canada, or has he simply adopted the view that his main responsibility is energy revenues, and the health of the industry and future exploration is not something he really has to be concerned about?


Madam Speaker, I want to reassure the hon. member that the Minister of Finance is only thinking of introducing fair taxes. This is the view of this government as well.
Oral Questions INDUSTRY


Madam Speaker, my question is directed to the Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce. The minister indicated in his statement on October 3 that it is his government's view that, given an adequate refinancing plan, Massey-Ferguson will continue to play a strong role in the farm implement sector of the Canadian economy. Is the minister prepared, should the private sector fail to refinance Massey-Ferguson, to participate in an equity program with the government, the employees and the dealers buying shares and holding positions on the Massey-Ferguson board of directors recently vacated by Argus Corporation, to ensure that jobs and Canadian productivity are given highest priority?


Madam Speaker, we will be working actively with Massey and the Bank of Commerce to assist them to put together an adequate refinancing plan to achieve the kinds of objectives which the hon. member stated and which are, as he confirmed, very much those of this government. I do not think it would be helpful in reaching that objective to speculate at this time on what the final package may be and what the resulting role of the government may turn out to be.


My supplementary is to the same minister. I hope the minister appreciates the urgency of this in view of the fact that some of Massey's very heavy debt load comes due on a short-term basis at the end of October. Can the minister assure this House that adequate guarantees have been obtained from the creditors and suppliers of Massey-Ferguson Limited so that the loans coming due at the end of this month will not cause the conipany to go bankrupt before a refinancing plan can be put in place?


Madam Speaker, in my statement of October 3 I said that in the circumstances outlined in that statement the government expects the companies, lenders and suppliers to maintain their existing arrangements with the company to allow time for the Bank of Commerce and the company to put a refinancing plan in place. 1 have no information as yet that the lenders and suppliers will not be responding positively to this statement.


Madam Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister. Can the Prime Minister tell the House, and in particular his own party colleagues, just exactly what the promise was to British Columbians during the last election with respect to Liberal policies on the imposi-

October 7, 1980
Oral Questions
tion of a tax on the export of natural gas from British Columbia.


Madam Speaker, I made no promise in that regard. I understand that yesterday the hon. member quoted some statement made by one of our candidates. I am not aware of that, but I am looking into it.


Oh, oh!


I hope Madam Speaker will excuse me if I point out that the candidate was formerly a member of the Prime Minister's staff, three times a Liberal candidate in B.C., and leader of the Liberal party in the legislative assembly. His name is Gordon Gibson. He put this in writing, and-


Order, please. Will the hon. member ask his question. I do not think that is actually a question.


Madam Speaker, the truth is sometimes hard to get at around here; it takes a few words. Mr. Gibson said this in writing on February 13-


Question.


Order, please. 1 ask the hon. member to co-operate by going immediately to the question and not quoting. I do not think that is necessary. The statement is probably known by the Prime Minister and he can answer. Will the hon. member now ask his question?


Madam Speaker, keeping in mind your admonition, which could be a matter of some debate later-


Oh, oh!


Order, please.


May I ask the Prime Minister this. Does the Prime Minister consider himself bound by solemn commitments made by Gordon Gibson as the leading Liberal candidate to the effect that there would be no tax on the export of natural gas from British Columbia, that that was the policy of the Liberal party and the policy of the energy critic, the present Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources, as expressed in writing in a newspaper in the province of British Columbia? It is no use looking to the energy minister because he will not answer the question.


Hear, hear!


Madam Speaker, the hon. member and perhaps his party will be interested to know that at the beginning of the last election campaign we put together a platform committee composed of 20 members appointed by caucus, 20 members appointed by the federation from among members of the party and people across the land. This platform was put together and approved by the Deputy Prime Minister and by myself.


Oh, oh!


I thought perhaps the opposition could learn how to put a program together.


Hear, hear!


The point, Madam Speaker, is that we put this platform together, we published it and made it public. The item referred to by the hon. member was not in that platform. It is true that-


Oh, oh!


Listen and learn.


That's right. I cannot say it; I hope you heard
it.


Order, please. This is really going on too long. I would ask hon. members to please stop shouting so that this question can be dealt with efficiently.


Madam Speaker, the hon. member is a politician. He knows that in an election campaign many people who stand for election undertake to make their best efforts to obtain certain things if they are elected. I cannot, nor could any party leader, monitor the statements.


Give an answer.


If the loudmouth would please be quiet, Madam Speaker, then I might be able to give him the answer that he is asking for.


Madam Speaker, my question is further to that asked by the hon. member for Brant in connection with Massey-Ferguson and is directed to the Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce. The minister is being a somewhat reluctant bridegroom in his pursuit of the negotiations with Massey-Ferguson. He is much more aggressive in the negotiations with Chrysler Corporation. Will the minister inform the House in what way Massey-Ferguson is different from Chrysler Corporation, apart from the fact that many workers of Chrysler Corporation live in the ridings of Windsor where there are three Liberal ministers.


Oh, oh!


Madam Speaker, there is a great similarity between the Massey and Chrysler cases. With regard to the Chrysler case, there were some eight months of negotiations before a final decision was arrived at. If I am not mistaken, discussions with the previous Conservative government began in August, 1979, and there had not been a conclusion at the time the government changed. This went on for some months further
October 7, 1980

before a decision was reached which was in the best interests of the employees of the company, the suppliers, the dealers and the Canadian economy as a whole. I think I am following a sound precedent in making sure that in working on this matter we do come up with the best solution for the company, its workers, suppliers and dealers, and the economy as a whole. I hope my hon. friend will not disagree with that.


A supplementary question, Madam Speaker. In view of the reluctance the government has shown in providing any support to Massey-Ferguson because that support might be perceived as being support for or a bail-out of the Argus Corporation, what impact on the negotiations has there been as the result of the donation of Argus's shares in Massey-Fer-guson to the Massey-Ferguson pension fund?


Madam Speaker, we pointed out in the statement I issued on behalf of the government on October 3 that we have decided to work closely with Massey, the Bank of Commerce and other interested principals in order to assist them in putting together an adequate plan for the refinancing of the company. We had been pressing the company, the banker and other principals to come forward with an adequate refinancing plan, and when they failed to agree among themselves on the details of such a plan we decided to take this further initiative in the interests of the workers, the company itself, the dealers and the many farmers across the country with Massey equipment, in a way which would respect and bear in mind the best interests of Canadian taxpayers and the economy as a whole.
In this instance our position is no less forthcoming than that of the government of Ontario, which has certainly been no more ready to provide immediate assistance than the federal government. I notice that my hon. friend has not said a word about that.


Madam Speaker, my question is addressed to the Minister of Consumer and Corporate Affairs, and it relates to recent developments involving two of our major newspaper chains.
Given that the present director of the combines investigation branch feels that present legislation provides "periodic licence to engage in illegalities", which certainly identifies the lack of teeth in that legislation, given the fact that the legislation is very weak regarding advance notice of transactions and, of course, weak in providing any encouragement for the Attorney General to take action, and given the fact that it takes up to four years for an investigation and three years for a prosecution, will the minister tell this House when he plans to bring the former bill C-13 to counteract this, and why has he not brought it in before this date?
Oral Questions


Madam Speaker, obviously, an inquiry being under way, it becomes difficult to make any observations on the matter brought up by the hon. member.
On the other hand, the question of the hon. member allows me to confirm to the House the intention of the government to table, in the near future, the amendments to the competition legislation in order to strengthen the section dealing with mergers. I trust that, when this bill comes up for study in the House, I shall get the support not only of the hon. member who put the question to me, but as well that of all other hon. members.


My supplementary question, Madam Speaker, refers to the action or, perhaps, inaction on the part of the minister some weeks back when he failed to initiate an inquiry. 1 should like to ask why he gave the Canadian people the impression that he was initiating an inquiry when in fact it was the result of the efforts of six individuals?


Madam Speaker, I deny the allegations of the hon. member. Quite the opposite is true: immediately after the merger was annouced, I asked my officials to make a preliminary study to determine whether in fact a formal inquiry was warranted. As we know, the law provides various ways of setting up a formal inquiry. At the time when those officials were in the process of formulating their recommendations with regard to holding a formal inquiry, a number of consumers requested one, which was set up immediately under the act.


Madam Speaker, my question is directed to the Minister of Finance. In view of the present trend toward higher interest rates and the disastrous effects they have on the fragile economies of the Atlantic provinces, with which the minister is familiar, is the minister going to be taking any measures to either hold the line on interest rates or cushion their effects on the Atlantic provinces?


Madam Speaker, 1 have under consideration at the present time a number of possible options that might be used not only in the Atlantic provinces but elsewhere, but I am not sure at this stage what the final decision will be.


Madam Speaker, I would like to thank the minister for his answer and ask whether he will implement the December last budget proposals to stimulate the shipbuilding

Oral Questions
industry, to provide tax incentives for regional development, and possibly help lower income families through an energy tax credit system?


Madam Speaker, the hon. member has mentioned the shipbuilding industry and probably has reference to a proposal that had been made by a former minister in respect of Atlantic fishing vessels. 1 found that proposal to have certain flaws in it, but it is still under consideration.


Madam Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Justice. There have been some foolish suggestions by some provincial politicians that the constitutional package being proposed by our government has all kinds of hidden powers which will do the provinces in. The Leader of the Opposition last night clearly went as far as to suggest that the "bogey man" was hidden there.


Make your speech later.


For the public record, Madam Speaker, will the Minister of Justice assure this House that the constitutional package proposed by this government does not address itself to the question of offshore resource jurisdiction, or the question of resource sharing?


Madam Speaker, I want to assure the hon. member that we were very careful in drafting that document not to begin to change the balance of powers between federal and provincial governments. That is why we are not making changes in terms of resources or anything at this moment. We wanted to avoid completely touching the sharing of powers. We wanted to patriate the constitution and provide a bill of rights for Canadians so all Canadians will have their rights protected forever in the constitution.


Hear, hear!


Madam Speaker, in light of the remarkable statement just made by the Minister of Justice, which absolutely contradicts something he said on the weekend relative to the imposition of a natural gas export tax, and in view of the government's implied plans to plunder western provinces by levying a discriminatory export
October 7, 1980
tax on natural gas, a measure which is equivalent to imposing a supplementary income tax of $500 on every resident of British Columbia, and recognizing that thousands of British Columbians are declaring their absolute rejection of an excise tax on natural gas and hydroelectric power throughout B.C., will the Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources indicate whether the government will now honour its election commitment quoted by my colleague, the hon. member for Vancouver South, and promise to the people of British Columbia, as promised last February as well, that it will renounce any plan to impose a federal excise tax on the export of natural gas or hydroelectric power from British Columbia?


Madam Speaker, if the hon. member can avoid dying of apoplexy between now and the budget 1 think he will have his answer, but we will have to wait and see.


Madam Speaker, this is not a matter of dying of apoplexy; it is a matter involving the death of this country, which is what is at stake.


Hear, hear!


1 would suggest that if that proposal to impose an export tax was contained-


Order, order.


Order, please. Would the hon. member ask his question, please.


Madam Speaker, I would ask the Prime Minister why he does not show courage here and now by admitting to the people of western Canada at this time that the government intends to proceed with an export tax on natural gas? Admit it!


Madam Speaker, my question is to the Minister of National Health and Welfare. We on this side certainly agree about the importance of the report presented by Mr. Justice Hall, and we have observed the apparent difficulty in its utilization. The minister has shown us her uncertainty about what course to follow.


Let's have your question.


In view of the importance of proper, affordable medical care for Canadians and a just return for physicians, will the minister refer the Hall report to committee so that Justice Hall and other witnesses may be examined and we can assist in developing a method of solving this difficulty?

October 7, 1980


Madam Speaker, I find the idea interesting. However, the hon. member should remember that the Standing Committee on Health, Welfare and Social Affairs of the House of Commons has a very heavy workload. In particular, there are several subcommittees set up right now. 1 will, however, explore that and look at it as a mechanism which may help strengthen medicare.
The hon. member says that I am not sure, or some such expression. He said I did not know what 1 was saying. I would like to call his attention to page 28 of the report where very precisely Justice Hall tells us the following:
Nor is it within the constitutional authority of the federal government to legislate the way in which a province and the physicians ... enter into an agreement.
He goes on very clearly to say that it is none of my darned business to reject binding arbitration, but it is up to the provinces to do so; so I hope the hon. member will correct his way of speaking on the issue of medicare and recognize that we know where we stand. We want to save medicare.


Madam Speaker, I am aware of the report and what it holds. 1 am wondering if, in pointing out that the workload of the committee is very heavy, the minister is aware, which I am sure she is, of the anxiety that Canadians are going through today in switching from family physicians they have had for many years in order to find physicians who have opted into medicare. I wonder if she is aware of the erosion of faith and trust in our physicians and our medical system today. 1 wonder if she is aware that we are forcing physicians-


Order, please. Does the hon. member have a question which is a supplementary question?


In view of the fact that we are forcing physicians to take action they do not want to take, will the minister please review the committee's workload and ensure that there is a spot for consideration of the Hall report?


Madam Speaker, 1 think the time for action has come, and if the hon. member wants one more study, as 1 said earlier, I will look into that possibility, but when he appears as an angel and suddenly realizes that medicare is in some danger, he is saying and confirming what many people in different provinces of the country do not acknowledge. He is saying, "Yes, premiums have caused damages," as Justice Hall says; "Yes, extra billing was popping up here and there in the country; yes, some provinces were having new user fees or increasing their user fees". That is what we said a year and a half ago when nobody else was acknowledging it. We said that that was a problem.


Do something about it.


Justice Hall confirmed it. We are trying to solve that problem, and we will continue to do so until medicare is back to normal.

Madam Speaker, my question is directed to the Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources. In view of the continuing situation in Iran and Iraq, could the minister assure the House that Canadians throughout the country will not experience a shortage of heating fuel this winter?


Madam Speaker, 1 thank the hon. member for this very important question. I would like to reassure Canadians that despite the current conflict in the Middle East, oil supplies are at such a level in Canada this year that we have every reason to believe there will not be any shortage of oil and heating fuel in particular during winter, contrary to the situation that occurred last fall when there was much worrying and the previous government had neglected to take appropriate action to prevent such a development.


Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order to seek clarification from the Chair in terms of how we are to conduct our business for the next few days.
Today the hon. member for Humber-Port au Port-St. Barbe (Mr. Tobin) asked a question of the Minister of Justice (Mr. Chretien) regarding a clarification of the draft resolution which is on the order paper and which will be the order of business today. The Minister of Justice was given permission to answer that question. That question was directly related to the draft resolution before us, so I ask Your Honour whether that was a different question from questions which can be asked relating to constitutional renewal. The question was very specific as it related to the motion which is before this House at this time and which will be called in a few minutes. As I heard it, the question was not only specific but was also clearly meant to undermine the ability of the opposition to debate the issue. As the government is having difficulty in clarifying its position, the question period is being used for those specific clarifications. That should be done in debate.


Hear, hear!


If clarifications are necessary, it is incumbent upon members of the cabinet to rise in debate and to give those clarifications and not to use the question period, unless the rules pertaining to the question period and the orders have changed. If that is the case, I would like a clarification. If it is the case, then obviously we can ask questions during the

October 7, 1980
Point of Order-Mr. Crombie
question period on specifics regarding the draft resolution, and 1 suggest that the question period would become a shambles. In view of what has happened today in the House, I ask for clarification.


I shall take that point of order under consideration. It is true that questions in the question period should not relate to the order of the day. I do not know in advance what the question is going to be; therefore I just have to allow questions to be asked. It is not clear to me whether this point of order is justified at this point. I will have to go back and check the record. I shall do just that, and I thank the hon. member for raising the point.


Madam Speaker, I rise on the same point of order.


Order!


I am not sure that I can entertain more discussion on this point. I did say that I would take it under advisement. Unless the hon. member wants to give me some supplementary information which I cannot get through reading Hansard, I think I have to tell the hon. member that I will not
