Madam Speaker, I rise under the provisions of Standing Order 43. The unemployment insurance program has long ceased to be an insurance program and is, in reality, a payroll tax scheme. The other night, the Minister of Finance increased this payroll tax from $3.24 to $4.32 per $100 of earnings.
This tax increase on working people represents a hidden billion dollars of revenue to the government. It represents to the ordinary working person, people earning $290 a week or less, over two weeks pay to the government over and above income taxes, sales tax, duties and now new taxes on their home heating costs.
I move, seconded by the hon. member for Parry Sound-Mus-koka (Mr. Darling):
That the Minister of Employment and Immigration justify on motions the seizure of over two weeks' pay from the working people of this country, justify this additional billion dollars taken out of the pockets of working people, and justify his inefficient and inept handling of unemployment insurance.

Madam Speaker, I rise under the provisions of Standing Order 43 on a matter of urgent and pressing necessity. As the federal government appears to be exceeding its constitutional authority and transgressing the constitutional powers of the provinces in imposing a federal tax and royalty on provincial resources in contradiction of section 109 and section 125 of the BN A Act, I move,
seconded by the member for Wetaskiwin (Mr. Schellenberg-er):
That the federal government immediately refer to the Supreme Court, for a constitutional opinion and ruling, both its budgetary 8 per cent tax on net revenues from oil and gas and its domestic and export tax of 30 cents per 1,000 cubic feet on natural gas and liquefied petroleum products.
I am certain that in the interest of constitutional correctness the government would not hesitate to make such a reference.

Madam Speaker, I rise to move a motion under the provisions of Standing Order 43. The motion has been drafted in consultation with groups such as Amnesty International.
In view of the fact that over 300 dissenters in the Soviet Union have been sentenced to terms of imprisonment, exile or have been forcibly confined to psychiatric hospitals since 1975, and in view of the increase in the arrests of dissenters in the Soviet Union which now exceeds 100 since October, 1979, I move, seconded by the hon. member for Dauphin (Mr. Lewycky):
That this House condemns the Soviet Union for its widespread harassment, imprisonment and physical ill-treatment of people such as the well known Anatoly Shcharansky; the Russian human rights campaigner, Malva Larda; the well known Russian orthodox activist, Viktor Kapitanchuk; and Zinovy Kra-sivsky and Olha Matusevych, who are members of the Ukrainian Helsinki monitoring group, as well as others ill-treated for their non-violent exercise of their human rights, and urges the Canadian delegation to the Madrid Conference in November to make these views known to the delegates from the U.S.S.R.

Madam Speaker, I rise under the provisions of Standing Order 43 to propose a motion on a matter of urgent importance to the public service employees of Canada. Given that Tuesday's depression budget shows a cash requirement some $2 billion less than the projected deficit of over $14 billion, largely because the pension funds of government employees are plundered each year to finance a substantial portion of the national debt, and whereas the public service pension contributions are not secured by any form of investment in equity, as they ought to be, I move, seconded by the hon. member for Cambridge (Mr. Speyer):
That the government be directed to stop using dishonestly the pension contributions of public service employees, RCMP and armed forces employees to help pay for the extravagantly wasteful excesses of the Liberal government and, furthermore, that a royal commission be called now to investigate the scandalous mismanagement and misuse of the government superannuation accounts.

Whereas a number of Indian band councils in western Canada and perhaps in other parts of our country are endeavouring to get off welfare and raise their standard of living through the development of their natural resources, and whereas the Indian Act exempts our Indian reservations and the Indians from taxation directly or indirectly, I therefore move, seconded by the hon. member for Leth-bridge-Foothills (Mr. Thacker):

That the members of this House affirm their support for the creation of an economically viable Canadian deep sea merchant fleet and recognize that this fleet would further encourage development of a full range of Canadian marine industries, including a world class shipbuilding industry, so that Canadians would have the opportunity to obtain a greater share of the economic and employment benefits of this industry.

Madam Speaker, I rise under the provisions of Standing Order 43. Nature conservationists have strongly criticized the federal government for permitting fur ranchers in Canada to import from Europe so-called "raccoon dogs" or Japanese foxes, as they are sometimes called, which could devastate domestic farm crops and wildlife in this country if they escaped or were released. I therefore move, seconded by the hon. member for Esquimalt-Saanich (Mr. Munro):
That this House urge the government to require fur ranchers to send all Japanese foxes or raccoon dogs back to Europe; to compensate the ranchers for their losses; and to pass strict laws to prevent the importation of all exotic animals except those proven to be harmless and over which complete control can be exercised.

Madam Speaker, I rise under Standing Order 43 to seek redress from a news item and map which appeared in this morning's Ottawa Citizen and dealt with a Canadian government map which excised the province of Alberta out of confederation in favour of Saskatchewan. it is quite one thing for my province to be excised at the wellhead, but it is quite another thing to be excised out of existence.
I therefore move, seconded by the hon. member for Calgary West (Mr. Hawkes):

Rush after them their favour to curry.
Because, after all, they're Liberals in a hurry;

Madam Speaker, I have a question for the Secretary of State for External Affairs that flows out of the possibility that new difficulties have arisen in the government's attempt to have Britain decide constitutional questions which Canada should decide here in Canada. The Secretary of State will know from British news reports that the British government does not want to become the arbitrator between the Canadian federal government and the provincial governments on amendments to the British North America Act. The reports relate both to alleged communications between the British government and Canadian representatives and to more recent statements by British government spokesmen.
My first question is: Has there been any suggestion, in correspondence or conversation involving ministers or representatives of the two governments, to the effect that the British government wants basic Canadian disagreements to be resolved in Canada before Ottawa asks Britain to resolve them?


Madam Speaker, there has been no such request made by the government of the United Kingdom. There was a news story published this morning with which I am acquainted-it was also denied at 10 Downing Street this morning-to the effect that no message had been sent to the Canadian government as that earlier communique suggested.
There was also a news report stating that my colleague the Minister of the Environment and I, while in England, were told that the British government would not accommodate a request to patriate the constitution in the face of violent provincial disagreement during this year's parliamentary session. That report is entirely false.


Madam Speaker, I understand, as does this House, that the minister's department earlier denied the report in The Times as it was written. That was not my question. My question was: Has there been any suggestion communicated, in conversation or in any other communication, between British

October 30, 1980
Oral Questions
government ministers or representatives and Canadian government ministers or representatives suggesting that the British would want basic Canadian disagreements to be resolved in Canada before Ottawa asks Britain to resolve them? I am not asking for paragraph by paragraph verification of The Times story; I am asking the question whether or not there has been any suggestion to that effect conveyed in any way by any representatives of the British government to the Canadian government.


Madam Speaker, there has certainly been no proposal or request of that kind in our discussions with the British government. We had a free-flowing discussion, and while many possibilities were canvassed, as happens in a discussion of this nature, certainly that was not the way in which the conversation ended. There was no request, suggestion or proposal of that kind.


Madam Speaker, I believe that the minister has now said that there was no suggestion of that kind at any time. If that is what he intended to say, 1 would like him to verify his statement. Since the government strategy document anticipated provincial and parliamentary opposition to certain parts of the Liberal proposal, will the minister tell the House of Commons whether Canadian ministers or representatives raised with the British government or representatives the possibility of disagreement here in Canada and the possibility that Britain might have to decide questions that are deeply contentious in Canada?


We certainly acquainted the British government and its representatives with the fact that there would be disagreement in Canada. That was already apparent at the time we saw them but, of course, there was a common assumption on both sides that the normal constitutional convention in the United Kingdom would be followed, namely, that the advice of the Canadian government would be the advice heard by the British government and that a joint resolution of the Canadian Parliament would be what is accepted by the British Parliament.


Madam Speaker, the minister and the rest of the House will know that detailed memoranda of conversations of this kind are kept. In light of the extraordinary circumstances, it being important that all members of Parliament know exactly what was discussed between ministers and, indeed, between officials on this question, and in light of the extraordinary situation of the government seeking a joint address on a matter that is contentious in Parliament and a matter of disagreement among the provinces and under challenge in the courts, I wonder if the minister would agree to publish the Canadian memoranda of the conversations in which he and his colleague, the minister responsible for the environment and other things, participated. In these extraordinary circumstances I wonder if there would be a willingness to publish those memoranda.


Madam Speaker, I do not think that would be in accord with the precedents nor with the practice, because it would remove the sense of confidentiality all sides have in discussions of this kind.
As I mentioned to the Right Hon. Leader of the Opposition, there was free-flowing discussion with various representatives of the British government. We have stated here the conclusions of that discussion. I do not think it would be appropriate to go through the discussion here in Parliament.


Madam Speaker, my question is directed to the same minister. I want to reiterate that it is our belief that this is a Canadian matter, that we should patriate the constitution with an amending formula which has widespread support here in Canada and that all future amendments should be made in Canada.
In view of the at best very weak denial he issued this morning-his press release says that he denies the story as written, so the minister is obviously leaving a fair amount of doubt that there was veracity to the story in The Times this morning^-just on this narrow point, what would be the position of the government of the United Kingdom if there was widespread disagreement in Canada, including among the provinces? Can the minister answer that specific question?


Madam Speaker, I do not know to what communication this morning the hon. member is referring. I issued no press release this morning. In fact, my view was that the matter should await the House this afternoon where I assumed there would be questions. It may be that some answers were given by spokesmen for the department, but they were not intended to express our total reaction to the proposals or the comments which were being made by some British and Canadian media.
With respect to the precise question the hon. member asks, as I said, the common assumption on both sides during the discussion, which was never questioned by anyone and in fact has been expressly affirmed both in public and in private by the United Kingdom government, is that what the United Kingdom parliament looks to is a joint resolution of both Houses of this Parliament and nothing else.


Madam Speaker, my supplementary question is to the same minister and it flows out of his answer. It obviously raises the question of who is responsible in his department for press releases. More importantly, in view of the difficulty in which this minister has now put this House and in view of the various reports he has given, will he assure the House that he will make a statement on motions to explain clearly what happened.
Further, in view of the requests of a number of Canadians, notwithstanding also the premiers at the first ministers' conference, would the minister recommend to his cabinet colleagues
October 30, 1980

that an early meeting be convened between the Prime Minister and the premiers to discuss one agenda item only, namely, an amending formula, so that the joint address could then go forward with regard to patriation with an amending formula that would then have the widespread support all of us seek?


Madam Speaker, 1 will certainly give consideration to the hon. member's request for a statement on motions, but I will not accede to his request to change the policy of the government, which I fully support. There has been no ambiguity whatsoever in the statements made by me and the Minister of the Environment. We have stated with no ambiguity since our return-and, indeed, in the United Kingdom before our return-that the United Kingdom would follow the traditional convention that a joint resolution of this House would be followed by the British parliament and honoured by the British government, and that the only adviser to the British government on Canadian constitutional matters is the Canadian government.


Madam Speaker, my question is directed to the Minister of Finance. The figures which have been released by the minister in his budget indicate that he himself anticipates that unemployment will rise by over 100,000 this year, and indeed it is projected that over the next five years there will be on average one million unemployed Canadians and perhaps as many as 1.5 million if one includes the real unemployed.
In light of those figures, which I am sure the minister would agree are pretty shocking, I should like to ask him what he means when he says, on page 3 of his budget statement, that the budget which he has brought down is intended to restore, over time, among other things, a fully employed society. What does he mean by "a fully employed society", and what does he mean by "over time"?


Madam Speaker, the context of the budget anticipates for the short-term higher unemployment. The hon. member can have a dialectical argument, like we used to have ten or 15 years ago, as to what the concept of full employment would be. In this case I am talking about reduced unemployment over the time period forecast in the budget.


I am not a dialectician but 1 could describe the government's recipe as short-term pain for long-term pain. Because if the minister looks at his own projections, he will see that the unemployment figures at the end of the five-year period are just as high as they are now, and that the average over the five-year period is higher than now. That is not dialectics, those are straight facts. Can the minister please
Oral Questions
confirm that, on the facts which are contained both in the budget and in the medium-term prospects which are described in his budget papers, if you look at the real number of unemployed in Newfoundland, for example, in the early 1980s through to 1985 one out of every four or five Canadians will be unemployed and that the average for all of Canada will be one out of every ten Canadians unemployed over the next four or five years?


So?


I am asking the minister to confirm those figures, and he is saying "so".


What do you mean by "so"?


Madam Speaker, the figures in the document are accurate. The hon. member's interpretation of them is a bit suspect.


If my interpretation is suspect, I think the minister's complacency is nothing short of unbelievable.
My final supplementary concerns an article written in 1962 by someone describing himself as an economist by the name of Pierre Elliott Trudeau. The article is entitled "Economic Rights". At the end of this article the author writes:
-our laws . . . recognize as proprietors of an enterprise men who today hold a few shares ... whereas workers who may have invested the better part of their lives and of their hopes in a job have no proprietary right to that job, and may be expropriated ... whenever they grow old, whenever Capital decides to disinvest.
He describes that as an "erroneous concept of property". In light of all the statements that have been made by the minister in his document about the importance of labour mobility-and in fact he has turned the country into a nation of backpackers thanks to the levels of unemployment that he is expecting in many parts of our country-can he point specifically in his budget to any steps which have been taken which guarantee, not simply labour mobility, but the importance of providing some job protection, some pension guarantees and some economic security for those people who are affected by the 1,000 lay-offs per day that have been taking place over the past year and that we can be sure will be taking place over the next five years, thanks to this stand-pat-and-do-nothing budget.


Hear, hear!


The hon. member's rhetoric is about as outdated as the amendment which he proposed yesterday in the House which looked to me like a warmed over edition of the Regina manifesto.


A million unemployed is outdated?


He talked about intellectual bankruptcy. It was demonstrated clearly yesterday in his amendment and again in his questions.
May I indicate to the hon. member, if he is serious about the question of growth and unemployment in the economy, that I

October 30, 1980
Oral Questions
have acknowledged in the budget my view about the medium-term economic situation as one which does not give any cause for satisfaction. The solution proposed by the New Democratic Party is to inject a "stimulus" into the economy by increasing the deficit at this particular time. In my view, that prescription is likely to fail and will prevent this country from participating fully in an economic recovery which will likely take place in the second quarter of next year. That is why there has not been an effort in this budget to run up a deficit, which is very large already, and make our problems in the medium term more difficult. That is the stance taken by the government in the budget.
The hon. member talks about jobs. Apparently he is interested in jobs, but he has not understood the impact of the budget. In the economic development envelope this particular year we are increasing expenditures by 22 per cent in order to support activities in the economy which we think will make a long-term contribution to improved productivity and growth. In addition to that, we have provided a special amount of $350 million in order to deal with the important problems of restructuring and manpower adjustments.
Finally, the hon. member talked yesterday about industrial strategy. His concept of industrial strategy or development is very limited.


Order, order.


He is not answering today's question, he is answering yesterday's.


Madam Speaker, I sat through the budget on Tuesday night and a 50-minute-


Question, question.


It is coming, it is coming. We had a 50-minute "question period" yesterday and another 17 minutes of gobbledygook from the minister today


Question.


-and never was a meaningful word heard on behalf of the Canadian consumer. This budget leaves the consumer far worse off than the previous budget of my colleague, the hon. member for St. John's West.


Hear, hear!


Since this budget potentially permits a 75-cent per gallon increase in home heating fuel by 1983, why did the Minister of Finance not consider a
tax credit for home heating fuel or at least an increase in CHIP?


What about GIS?


Madam Speaker, I want to repeat a statement I made yesterday. It throws a good deal of light upon the difference between the impact of this particular budget on Canadian consumers of oil and gas in comparison with the impact of the budget which my hon. friend supported last December. The schedule of price increases of oil and gas over the period up to and including 1984 saves Canadian consumers $40 billion in comparison with the budget presented last December.


That is not true.


If my hon. friend wants to get some facts, I would ask him to read the speech given yesterday by the Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources.


Pinocchio.


In it he demonstrated very clearly that the price of gasoline, natural gas and home heating oil will be considerably lower under this budget than the one the hon. member supported last December, and that is why we are not providing an energy tax credit.


Hear, hear!


Oh, oh!


Madam Speaker, it just proves the point I was trying to make, that obviously the government cares nothing about the average consumer.


Question.


I have read enough speeches by the Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources, and I think other Canadians have read enough too.
My supplementary question is directed to the Minister of Consumer and Corporate Affairs wearing his hat as the Postmaster General. The budget indicates that there is no planned deficit in the Post Office. His own estimates show a deficit of $400 million which will require a minimum 10-cent increase to consumers in the price of first-class mail.


At least.

October 30, 1980


When does the minister plan to introduce this postage tax? How much will it cost us?


Madam Speaker, as it turns out, I answered that very question this morning before a parliamentary committee. Obviously the estimates introduced by the Minister of Finance cover the next four years and what we must keep in mind, therefore, is the fact that, whether a Crown corporation is set up or not, the Post Office Department will have to boost postal rates in 1981. That is nothing new, it has been said several times before. My predecessor as Postmaster General, the hon. member for Vancouver South, stated himself this morning that when he was minister he had plans to raise postal rates; he never did get around to it because of the change in government. Besides, and after two years without higher rates, it is only natural that they go up in 1981.


Madam Speaker, my question is for the Minister of National Health and Welfare. Given the impact of the budget on the elderly and those on fixed incomes, has the minister examined the budget with that fact in mind? For example, almost 40 per cent of the $35 increase in the GIS will be taken up with increases in the cost of heating oil in the months ahead. Has the minister examined the impact of the budget on the poor and the elderly? After one finishes reading through what the minister said in his budget, the bottom line is that the burden has shifted to the poor and the elderly.


Hear, hear!
[ Translation]


Madam Speaker, in my opinion the analysis of the hon. member is altogether erroneous. If he examines the budget he will see that it definitely includes the notion of indexation of social programs geared to the full cost of living, which has always been one of our priorities. It is obvious that the Minister of Finance has decided to act as firmly as possible to boost growth and productivity. These extra costs will be offset by automatic indexation and the suggestion of the hon. member is false and contrary to the budget his government itself introduced last December.


Madam Speaker, I stand behind what I said. The poor and the elderly of this country will experience what I am saying this winter. Given the fact that the energy and food
Oral Questions
portions of the consumer basket of the poor and the elderly is disoriented toward that fact-in other words, it is disproportionate-and that the consumer price index is the weighting scale for indexing, will the minister examine the consumer price index to see if it is relevant to the disproportionately high amount of the cost of living which must be paid out for food and fuel oil costs by the poor, the elderly and those on fixed incomes? If so, will she change it?


Madam Speaker, I have just returned from a fact-finding mission in a few European countries and I wish my colleague would have had the chance to join us. He would have seen in the discussions we had-and I am thinking in particular of Sweden-although that government, like many others, has decided to take the cost of oil and energy out of the consumer basket, out of the indexing indicator which will be used for the pensions of seniors, we have refused that approach in this country. We will keep the full consumer price index as the method of ensuring that, despite the unpleasant increases of different components of the consumer price index, our senior citizens and people under social programs, including families, will be fully protected.


Madam Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Finance. It is somewhat related to the question asked by my colleague. The minister speaks of economic recovery taking place in the second quarter of next year and the industrial redevelopment which he hopes will occur as a result of the budget initiatives.
Would the minister agree that the reduction in purchasing power which results from the increases that have taken place in costs in all the major areas of consumer spending can do nothing but reduce manufacturing, create higher unemployment levels, reduce the tax payable to the federal government and, in the final analysis, create an even larger deficit? What has the government done to reverse the trend which automatically flows from inflicting higher and higher costs on people in the essential areas, thereby causing this continual domino effect on the economy?


With respect to the first point, the hon. member has asked what the government has tried to do to support the economy. The hon. member will understand that at the present time the deficit is $14.2 billion, which is an amount we are putting into the economy in order to give it support and stimulate activity.
Now hon. members in that party want me to do more in that direction, to run up the deficit in order to undertake the kinds of projects which have been enumerated. Yesterday the hon. member for St. John's West spent a good part of his speech

October 30, 1980
Oral Questions
denouncing the budget because the deficit was too high. I believe that the deficit at the moment is appropriate to the weak output of the economy and that any greater effort to increase it would be counter-productive. That is the general posture of the government.
My hon. friend asks about-


Order!


Thank you.


Madam Speaker, a supplementary question. If we have an increase in unemployment of 100,000 persons this coming year, that will surely mean 100,000 people who will purchase less. If we reduce the consumer purchasing power of the balance of the population with the increases which the government has inflicted upon them in this budget, that will mean they will buy even less in the consumer marketplace, which will in itself result in even higher unemployment.


Question!


Order, please. Supplementary questions should be even shorter than the first question asked, but the question of the hon. member looks as if it might be longer. Would the hon. member please ask his question now.


What specific measure is there in this budget that will put an end to the domino effect which results from unemployment compounded on unemployment?


Madam Speaker, I am not sure I fully understand the hon. member's question, but I want to make one point to him. There is no way that I or the government can fully protect the Canadian consumer or citizen from increased energy or food prices. Most European countries and almost all of the OECD countries are fully absorbing world energy prices immediately. We have not done that. We have protected the Canadian consumer from the full impact of world price increases. But we have increased prices and there will be increased costs in the economy. Nothing I or the hon. member can say will change that if we want to face reality, one which is not only a Canadian reality but a worldwide reality.


Hear, hear!


Madam Speaker, my question is addressed to the Minister of Finance. He has said he believes his deficit is appropriate. However, that does not appear to be what the marketplace is saying, with the Toronto Stock Exchange index down 74 points since Tuesday, the oil and gas index down 600 points, federal government bonds, which were bought only four months ago, down 15 per cent, the dollar into the 84-cent range once again, and hundreds of
millions of dollars going out of the country. Now it has been announced the bank rate is up four-tenths of a point over last week.


Shame!


Would the minister indicate, now that we have had the energy statement, when do we get his budget in the hope that it might steady the market?


Madam Speaker, the forces in the market which have accounted for the increased bank rate today were quite evident before the budget was brought down.


Oh!


The same is true of the slight weakening of the Canadian dollar. So the hon. member is drawing a very long bow if he is attempting to relate one to the other.


Surely it is unforgivable that a Minister of Finance would say that the forces which are driving up interest rates in this country were evident before he brought in his budget, yet in that budget he did nothing to correct that trend.


Hear, hear!


In view of the fact that federal rates are now near 14 per cent for long-term bonds-that is the rates on Canada bonds-which indicates that mortgage rates are likely going to the 15 per cent or 16 per cent level, would the minister indicate what he intends to do to help the home owners in this country who have to renew mortgages, or those people who would like to buy houses in the future?


Madam Speaker, if he shares the view his deskmate expressed yesterday that the deficit is too large, even as it presently exists, then he would be the first to urge me not to undertake another new major spending program to add to that already high deficit.


Madam Speaker, my question is addressed to the Minister of Finance. Can he give us the reasons he chose to effect a somewhat smaller deficit reduction in this budget than his predecessor did in his budget?


Oh, oh!


Madam Speaker, I think it is an important question.


Hear, hear!
October 30, 1980


l would make a clarifying observation, namely, that the former minister of finance was projecting a decrease of the existing deficit, over the time-frame, of about $2 billion, and that is exactly what I am doing, effective at the end of 1984. The hon. member for York-Peel said the deficit went up this year, which is absolutely right. It increased because of increased payments on the debt as a result of higher interest payments, interest rates which had run up even more explosively under the former government than under the present government.


Hear, hear!


It went up because of increased payments on oil compensation, which hon. members opposite would have had to pay in any event. I accepted those increased expenditures because of weak economic performance.


Order, please.


Madam Speaker, I should also like to direct a question to the Minister of Finance. Since the largest group of energy users in our society is those engaged in agriculture, and more specifically farmers, and in order to stop farm costs from absolutely skyrocketing under the added burden of the energy price increases that the minister announced on Tuesday night, there will have to be either a tax credit or some other kind of assistance given to agriculture or we will see absolutely skyrocketing farm prices. There was no indication of agricultural measures in the budget at all. What is the government considering doing for agriculture?


Sending Whelan to the Senate.


Madam Speaker, we took action in the budget on Tuesday night to assist the agricultural industry by not proceeding with an 18-cent tax on gasoline and by bringing in a much lower cost structure for the agricultural industry.


Madam Speaker, a supplementary question. The increased costs vary but there are some estimates that grain farmers, for example, will experience as much as a 15 or 20 cents per bushel increase because of additional energy requirements, since agriculture is such a high component in the use of energy. May I ask if any special consideration is going to be given to the agricultural sector? I would remind the minister that the answer he just gave me is not satisfactory.


Madam Speaker, I cannot understand why the answer should be unsatisfactory when the budget on Tuesday night provided a lower cost structure for the agricultural industry than the budget of last December, which the hon. member supported.
Oral Questions


My question is also for the Minister of Finance. Surely the minister is aware of hardships in the construction industry, not only in the province I represent but throughout the country as well. The Minister of Finance also knows about the difficulties facing small home owners and other prospective buyers. Given these circumstances, having failed to provide anything in the budget to cope with staggering interest costs, would the Minister of Finance, despite all his pious arguments about the budget, be prepared to reassure those thousands of Canadians and promise very special assistance to small home owners to help them face interest costs?


No, Madam Speaker, I cannot give the assurance that there will be a special program. I could not give the assurance earlier in the year, when interest rates were higher than they are at present, that the treasury could support an additional program of that size and expenditure magnitude. We made clear during the election campaign that we would not proceed with the mortgage interest deductibility program that had been part of the policy of the last government, and we do not propose to proceed with that program or any other program at the present time.


A supplementary, Madam Speaker. If I heard correctly, the Minister of Finance has no intention of helping small home owners who are facing enormous difficulties and who are not yet at the end of their rope if we keep in mind that the minister did say the inflation spiral would continue at roughly 10 per cent. That being so, would the minister not show a little more sympathy for those small owners and tell us that in the near future he will introduce a measure, First to save those who already have homes and then to enable other Canadians to become home owners?


Madam Speaker, I recall that earlier in the year I examined this question very carefully in the light of the considerable interest rate increases that had occurred in relation to home owners who had undertaken the obligation of paying increased mortgage rates. After an examination of that problem I concluded, based upon the objective facts, that a very, very high proportion of those home owners, because of their increased incomes since mortgages had been taken out, and taking into account the normal relationship between income and payments for housing, could manage on their own resources.
We did undertake at that time to consider a program, not a financial program but a rearrangement of mortgages that

would assist a group that might be affected. That seems to have worked very well and up to this point has made unnecessary a very large expenditure program which is obviously being advocated by my hon. friend. I just do not have the resources at the present time to finance any other new programs.


Why?


If I take the advice of the hon. member for St. John's West, I should be cutting down the current expenditures listed for the government.


Madam Speaker, I should like to direct a question to the Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources. Yesterday the minister stated it was the government's intention to complete a Quebec-Maritimes pipeline. In view of the fact that 100 per cent of the pipe for the western pipeline is being made in Canada, could the minister tell the House whether he has ascertained if the industries in Canada will have the capability of producing the pipe which will be necessary for the completion of the Quebec-Maritimes pipeline in the desired time?


Of course they will.


Madam Speaker, I think there is no reason to doubt that the pipe provided for that pipeline will come from Canadian steel companies.
apply to persons in high income brackets. That is acknowledged. The impact will be on increasing rental accommodation. I responded to representations not only from persons in the construction business but also to representations made at the recent ministers of finance meeting and representations made to me by members of the House of Commons, as well as by the minister who advised me that at the present time this would be the most appropriate way to provide additional stimulus. I noticed yesterday in one of the Toronto papers that it was stated the impact would be to create about 10,000 additional jobs, and I think that is rather important.


Madam Speaker, social housing would create just as many jobs. I wonder if the minister talked to tenants. Does the minister realize that from 1974 to 1979, the MURB period, over $315 million was added to our national debt because of MURB tax write-offs, yet during the same period, construction of rental units dropped by 41 per cent? Since MURBs cost so much, benefited only the rich, I repeat, and made no impact on priority housing problems of Canadians, will the minister reconsider his decision or at least invest a similar amount in non-profit and co-op housing for those who most need it?


Madam Speaker, there has been consistent support by this government for co-operative housing and non-profit housing. One just has to travel the country to see the impact of the housing program. I believe that the introduction of this particular tax problem will have a beneficial effect on increasing rental accommodation in cities especially, where the vacancy rate is very very low. It will also have the substantial effect of creating jobs in the construction agency whose unions, I understand, are very much in support of this particular policy.


Madam Speaker, my question is also directed to the Minister of Finance. Since it is well documented by the Canadian Council on Social Development that MURB tax write-offs in the past did absolutely nothing to help build affordable rental accommodation for families, for native people or for pensioners, and that in fact family homes were often demolished in order to build fancy, expensive luxury bachelor apartments, why did the minister respond to the pressures from the real estate lobby to reintroduce MURB tax write-offs for the wealthy instead of investing in social housing to try to deal directly with Canada's most desperate housing problem?


Madam Speaker, the hon. member is distorting the purpose of the program, which is to increase rental accommodation through a tax shelter which may indeed


Madam Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources. It relates to the intent of the policy announced in the budget to increase Canadian ownership in the oil and gas industry. The budget states that one objective is to achieve at least 50 per cent Canadian ownership of production by 1990, down from the current level of foreign ownership of about 70 per cent. In order to achieve this, exploration and development incentives will be phased out by the end of 1983 for all companies more than 50 per cent foreign owned.
My question is this. Is it the policy of the government to reduce the ownership level of all companies within the industry to the 50 per cent level, or is the policy related to the industry in the aggregate; in other words, to reduce the level of ownership to 50 per cent in the aggregate? As well, could the
October 30, 1980

minister answer in what time-frame he is trying to achieve this? Is it related to the phasing out of the incentives?


Madam Speaker, the objective of the government is to reduce foreign ownership to less than 50 per cent in the industry as an aggregate. We do not foresee, for instance, the elimination of any oil or gas company in Canada that would be more than 50 per cent owned. But what we are concerned about is that overall there would be at least 50 per cent Canadian ownership, and that in the larger companies there would be a significant increase in Canadian controlled companies, that is, companies actually managed and controlled by Canadians. This is a very strong part of our policy and we have announced a number of steps to achieve it.
As far as Canadian ownership is concerned, we have indicated that it will be before 1990 and we have announced steps that I hope will achieve this objective well within this decade. We have not set a specific year within the decade, but we want to make sure that by 1990, at least, this objective will have been achieved, while the other objectives I have mentioned- greater control and a few acquisitions by the Government of Canada-are to be achieved in the early part of this decade.
As to the second part of the question asked by the hon. member with regard to the phasing out of some of the incentives, these are spelled out in detail in "The National Energy Program", and I would refer him to the tables published with that program.


Madam Speaker, I am aware of the phasing out of incentives. It is the concern I have which prompts the question. The primary objective, as stated by the government, was to achieve self-sufficiency during this period of time. Since the foreign-owned companies are a major element in achieving self-sufficiency, my question to the minister is this. Since the incentives for the foreign-owned companies-those companies which own more than 50 per cent offshore-are phased out, is there any intention of introducing at some time within the next ten-year period a change in the incentives to give encouragement to companies which bring in some degree of Canadian ownership but not the full 50 per cent, which would qualify them for the incentives?


Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his supplementary question. The phasing out of the incentives to the foreign-owned companies was put in the energy program to allow those companies to turn around and find Canadian partners and to bring Canadian ownership into their companies as they exist at the present time. We believe that the time lag we have provided for should allow those companies that want to achieve Canadian ownership. For those not wanting to open their companies to Canadians, we have stated that we are ready to buy them out. We will ensure that they will continue to work for Canada in order to achieve our self-sufficiency goal.
Our purpose is not to drive out all foreign companies by any means. As a matter of fact, and as the hon. member knows,
Point of Order-Mr. Johnston
the incentives for tar sands and heavy oil continue, including incentives for foreign companies. There are still incentives for foreign companies, but we would like them to concentrate their efforts in areas where there is most need to help us meet our goal of self-sufficiency.


I have received notice of a question of privilege from the hon. member for Skeena (Mr. Fulton). I see the President of the Treasury Board (Mr. Johnston) rising on a point of order.


Madam Speaker, Standing Order 43 is to be used for matters of urgent and pressing necessity and is to be based on facts. The hon. member for Richmond-South Delta (Mr. Siddon), dealing with the use of pension funds, suggested that the government was plundering these pension funds. He made allegations intended, I suggest, to frighten public service employees. These allegations are not based on any facts whatever. He made references to figures set forth in the statement by the Minister of Finance (Mr. MacEachen) with regard to the financial position taken over a multi-year perspective, which is the same as that in last December's statement by the then minister of finance. If this had been a matter of urgent and pressing necessity, I suggest the hon. member should have raised it at that time.


Madam Speaker, I have been raising questions with respect to the state of the public service superannuation accounts with this minister, in committee and in this House, for several months. I have not been getting any answers. Therefore it has become a matter of urgent and pressing necessity.


I understand the two hon. members do not have the same interpretation of these facts. Each is entitled to expose them as he sees fit. That is why we have debate in the House of Commons so facts can be refuted from time to time.
As I was saying before that point of order was raised, I have a notice of a question of privilege by the hon. member for Skeena. I require an hour's notice for questions of privilege, and I have not had quite that hour's notice. However, I could close my eyes to that. But when there is notice, if the hon. member looks at the Standing Order, he will see that he should give me a brief statement as to what his question of privilege is all about. He did not do that. The idea is to save the time of the House so that the Speaker, in advance, can look into the situation to be evoked during the course of the question of privilege.
Since the question of privilege does not flow from the deliberations of the House today, I will take his notice now, and ask him to raise it tomorrow.
