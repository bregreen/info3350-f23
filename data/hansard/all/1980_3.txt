Madam Speaker, I rise, under Standing Order 43, on a matter of urgent and pressing necessity certainly to drivers of many Ford Motor Company products in this country.
In view of disturbing information that the Ford Motor Company has known since 1971 that some automatic transmissions lurch into reverse from park, that at least six complaints a month have been received by Ford about these slipping transmissions, that there have been altogether 291 recorded cases-including 41 injuries and four deaths in Canada-and in view of the fact that the Ministry of Transport has been investigating these incidents since 1977, I move, seconded by the hon. member for Erie (Mr. Fretz):
That the government immediately introduce legislation which would empower the Government of Canada to recall the 1.5 million Canadian vehicles with the alleged defective transmissions, and not wait for the results of inquiries in the United States.


Such a motion requires the unanimous consent of the House. Is there unanimous consent?


Agreed.


No.

Madam Speaker, under the provisions of Standing Order 43, and seconded by the hon. member for Yorkton-Melville (Mr. Nystrom), I move:
That this House commends the Minister of Veterans Affairs on the assurances he gave to the Royal Canadian Legion at its Dominion Convention in Penticton, British Columbia, on Monday of this week, that he would soon be bringing in legislation respecting veterans and their survivors, and this House urges the minister to do so before the end of this month.


Such a motion requires the unanimous consent of the House. Is there unanimous consent?

Madam Speaker, I rise on a matter of urgent and pressing necessity under the provisions of Standing Order 43. In view of the fact that Canadians, who used to eat one meal a day outside their homes, are now eating two or more meals a day away from home, and in view of the fact that the federal government has imposed a 12 per cent federal sales tax on food service equipment, a tax which is inevitably passed along to the consumer in higher prices, I move, seconded by the hon. member for Hamilton-Wentworth (Mr. Scott):
That this House urge the Minister of Finance to remove the sales tax, an action which would allow the consumer to save money on meals eaten in commercial establishments, and an action which could slow down the rise in the consumer price index.


Such a motion requires the unanimous consent of the House. Is there unanimous consent?


Agreed.


No.


Madam Speaker, I am glad that the President of the Treasury Board (Mr. Johnston) is in the chamber. I move, under the provisions of Standing Order 43, seconded by the hon. member for Rosedale (Mr. Crombie):
That by reason of the importance of the Government of Canada giving leadership in the field of employee retraining, the President of the Treasury Board make a statement in the House prior to the summer adjournment on the proposals of the Government of Canada for retraining programs for its public servants.


Such a motion requires the unanimous consent of the House. Is there unanimous consent?

Madam Speaker, I rise, under the provisions of Standing Order 43, on a matter of urgent and pressing necessity.
In light of the fact that 2,500 children in metro Toronto alone are on day-care waiting lists, and in light of the fact that provincial day-care funds are dwindling dramatically, causing real, everyday problems to working mothers, I move, seconded by the hon. member for Waterloo (Mr. McLean):
That the government assume its responsibility to working mothers in this country by immediately undertaking discussions with social services ministers in the provinces to renegotiate the Canada Assistance Plan so that day-care will cease to be a luxury-priced item and will become available and affordable to all working mothers in this country.


Such a motion requires the unanimous consent of the House. Is there unanimous consent?


Agreed.


No.


Madam Speaker, I rise on a matter of urgent and pressing necessity under the provisions of Standing Order 43.
Since public transportation is very limited and not available to many Canadians who travel to work from rural to urban areas in the Atlantic provinces, and since contemplated oil price increases will result in substantially increased costs for these people, I move, seconded by the hon. member for St. John's West (Mr. Crosbie):
That the Minister of Finance be directed to implement the energy tax credit proposals contained in the December 11 budget to assist Canadians earning less than $21,000 per year.


Such a motion requires the unanimous consent of the House. Is there such consent?


Agreed.


No.


Madam Speaker, I rise, under the provisions of Standing Order 43, on a matter of urgent and pressing necessity.
Saskatchewan's provincial government recently approved Regina's first French school, and classes are scheduled to start next fall at Dr. Martin Leboldus High School in South Regina. I move, seconded by the hon. member for Kitchener (Mr. Lang):
That the House give unanimous support to this initiative which encourages the flourishing of the two official languages.


Under the terms of Standing Order 43, such a motion requires the unanimous consent of the House. Is there such consent?


Agreed.


No.


Madam Speaker, I rise, under the provisions of Standing Order 43, on a matter of urgent and pressing necessity to the native peoples of Canada.
Considering the fact that the native peoples of Canada will only be involved at what we consider to be a third-tier level at the first ministers' conference in the joint work on the topic of Canada's native peoples and the constitution, I move, seconded by the hon. member for Kindersley-Lloydminster (Mr. McKnight):
That provision be made for the native peoples of Canada to make official representations to federal and provincial ministers and their officials during the July 7 to July 25 session or the August 25 to August 29 session as posted in the Prime Minister's proposed agenda for constitutional reform.


Such a motion requires unanimous consent. Is there unanimous consent?

Since the collapse of the west coast salmon gillnet fisheries appears evident because of recent federal closures of the Fraser River and Rivers Inlet for chinook Fishing, and since British Columbia gillnetters cannot afford the harsh economic realities imposed by prolonged closures for conservation purposes, I move, seconded by the hon. member for Nanaimo-Alberni (Mr. Miller):
That the Government of Canada initiate early discussions with representatives of the fishermen to investigate how gillnetters might be compensated for their income losses and/or to consider some other long-term insurance type solution designed to eliminate or minimize the financial instability in the industry.


Such a motion would require the unanimous consent of the House. Is there unanimous consent?

Madam Speaker, I rise under the provisions of Standing Order 43. In view of the fact that there are many armed forces personnel and their families in Calgary and other centres who are eligible for welfare supplements, I move, seconded by the hon. member for Mal-peque (Mr. Gass):
That this House direct the Minister of National Defence to appoint a task force outside the chain of command to examine military pay and benefits in relation to the cost of living in various communities to which armed forces personnel and their families are posted.


Such a motion would require unanimous consent before it could be put to the House. Is there such consent?

Madam
Speaker, I rise under the provisions of Standing Order 43. On June 7, in Luxembourg, the North Atlantic Assembly voted on a draft resolution "condemning the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan as a violation of Afghanistan's sovereignty and territorial integrity and of the right of the Afghan people to self-determination".
The resolution went on to call for a strengthening of the NATO alliance. The NDP member for Selkirk-Interlake (Mr. Oral Questions
Sargeant) and Liberal Senator Royce Frith, members of the Canadian delegation, abstained from this vote. I therefore move, seconded by the hon. member for Dartmouth-Halifax East (Mr. Forrestall):
That this House condemns the NDP member for Selkirk-Interlake and Liberal Senator Royce Frith, and urges that they be removed immediately from the North Atlantic Assembly parliamentarians' group.


Such a motion requires the unanimous consent of the House. Is there unanimous consent?


Agreed.


No.


Madam Speaker, my question is for the somewhat elusive Minister of Finance. On Tuesday we heard bad news about increasing unemployment figures and today, as the minister knows, we have a cost of living increase announced of 1.2 per cent in May. That is a year over year increase of 9.4 per cent and an annualized rate of 14.4 per cent. But even more alarming is that the underlying rate of inflation, when we remove food and energy costs from the index, was also up 1.2 per cent, which is a year over year rate of 9.1 per cent, the highest since 1976.
Given this burgeoning inflation rate, would the minister now advise the taxpayers of Canada and the House that the government definitely and unequivocally is not going to remove indexing from the personal income tax system, as the Minister of Finance said was a probability several weeks ago and as his assistant said had a 50-50 chance? In view of this burgeoning inflation rate, will the minister now make it clear that the government is not going to attempt to take advantage of inflation to get additional revenues in an unfair manner from the people of Canada, and that this is definitely ruled out?


Madam Speaker, while the statistics on inflation are serious and have to be taken into account, I doubt whether the term "burgeoning" is justified. 1 am sure the hon. gentleman would not have described his forecast of inflation which he made last December for 1980 as burgeoning.
However, that aside, 1 am delighted the hon. member raised the question of indexation and the possible removal of indexation from the income tax system, particularly his use of the word "probability".


That was your word.

June 13, 1980
Oral Questions


The hon. gentleman says that "probability" was my word. I want to assure the House that it was not my word. I was asked by a newspaper reporter from Le Devoir whether I was considering the removal of indexation as a possible revenue measure. After he had brought to my attention the statistics which the hon. gentleman obligingly provided in his budget papers, showing that over the years there had been a revenue loss of some $5 billion to $8 billion as a result of indexation, what I said to the newspaper reporter was that, yes, that was one of the possibilities, side by side with other revenue measures which had to be considered in preparing the budget. That was the beginning, and that is the situation at the present time. It is a matter that obviously will be considered.
I understand the hon. gentleman himself stated that he had considered it at one time, and maybe he would permit me to do the same thing.


Madam Speaker, I made it very clear that I considered and rejected the removal of indexing in the income tax system. It was rejected.
I remind the minister that his deputy minister of finance, Mr. Stewart, in addressing a Senate committee on May 27 said that the forecast of last December was now going to be exceeded, so the likelihood is a rate in excess of 11 per cent. In view of these alarming figures, will the minister now tell this House that he is no longer considering the de-indexation of the personal income tax system, that he is not going to take advantage of the inflation that the government is permitting in this way, and that it is ruled out even though the Liberal member for Mercier has stated in the 74-page policy document of the Liberal party "that Canadians are undertaxed compared with people in many countries"? Even though Liberal members of Parliament believe they are undertaxed, will he rule out indexing and attacking lower income taxpayers in that manner?


Madam Speaker, obviously the hon. gentleman himself agreed with the analysis that Canadians were undertaxed, in view of the massive tax increase which was contained in his December budget.


Hear, hear!


Otherwise he would not have levied such very heavy taxes. I do not complain about the necessity for additional revenues. I believe that if we in this country are to make any progress in reducing the deficit, and if we are going to introduce any additional necessary programs, there may be a requirement for additional revenues. I have never concealed that.
The hon. member says that he considered de-indexation and had rejected it. I presume that he declared his rejection after he had prepared his budget, not before, and I will await the budget before finalizing my opinion on revenue sources.


Madam Speaker, the minister is the only person in the House who is like Wynken, Blynken and Nod all at the same time: he can do it all together. The specific question he has been asked is whether he would now tell the Canadian public that he will no longer contemplate the deindexation of the personal income tax system. That is the question.
Let me remind the minister that in the election campaign leading up to February 18, the Prime Minister and the people who campaigned with him never once mentioned to the Canadian people that they are undertaxed. They said they were being overtaxed. They never mentioned there was any need for government revenues being increased. So will the minister now confirm to the House that they will stick to their pre-election position and there will be no taxation increases, and that indexing is ruled out for now and forever as long as this government is in power?


Madam Speaker, the hon. member is creating, for his own purposes, a fictitious Liberal platform.


Oh, oh!


I happen to have been chairman of that platform committee and I know what was said with respect to taxation and new programs. For example, we said that if we were to introduce the guaranteed income supplement, we would bring in new taxes. The Prime Minister stated in the campaign that he would likely secure those taxes from the corporate sector. That is exactly what happened. But there was no pledge that there would be no tax increases under a new Liberal government.


Oh, oh!


Another flip-flop.


Madam Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Finance. Has he noted that the shares of the Royal Bank set a 1980 high yesterday, and that John Mitchell of Greenshields attributes the strength to lower interest rates, which he predicts will increase the bank's domestic profit by as much as 40 per cent in the fiscal year 1981 if present interest levels are maintained, raising profit to more than $10 a share in fiscal year 1981 compared with $7.40 a share in the current year?
If the minister is aware of that, is he also aware of the fact that the Royal Bank last lowered its prime interest rate one month ago today, when it went down to 13.75 per cent, and notwithstanding the bank rate having now gone down to 11.29 per cent as compared to the then 14.17 per cent, the Royal Bank prime rate has not come down nor have the prime rates of the other major banks?
June 13, 1980

If the minister has noted these facts, would he tell us whether he has inquired as to why prime rates are not coming down in a more direct relationship to the bank rate?


Madam Speaker, the hon. member seems to find some difficulty in accepting the notion of decreasing interest rates. The fact of the matter is that in the last number of weeks there has been what one might call a phenomenal decrease in interest rates, in the bank rate and in other rates in this country. I regard that as a most welcome development. The hon. member asked me to relate the bank rate to the prime rate. He knows that from time to time there are lags in these adjustments.


Quite a lag.


But the trend is downward. That is the important thing. The rates now are much lower than the high rates I inherited from his government.


Madam Speaker, my supplementary question is directed again to the Minister of Finance. He must know that the only meaningful interest rates for consumers in Canada are the prime rates and the rates they are paying on their mortgages and consumer loans, not the bank rate to which the Minister of Finance is referring.
Has the minister inquired from the chartered banks why, in fact, their prime rate structure has been static? It has not gone down over the last month; it has been static at 13.75 per cent, notwithstanding the bank rate drops in Canada and the rather sensational prime rate drops in the United States where prime rates are now lower than they are in Canada, whereas during the Clark years prime rates in the United States were higher. He knows that, because he is grinning.


Hear, hear!


Madam Speaker, I had the opportunity last night to spend several hours at a meeting with the Canadian Bankers' Association.


Oh, oh!


That is where you get your answers.


We know whose side you are on.


I discussed these and other questions with members of the banking fraternity. I want to assure the hon. member that the same vigilance this government has exercised with respect to establishing policies to bring about a decline in the bank rate also will be applied to the prime rate.


At least blush when you say that.


Madam Speaker, my supplementary question to the Minister of Finance is-when?
Oral Questions


Madam Speaker, the proof of the pudding is in the eating. The hon. member has been served it every day in the House in the way of lower rates.


Hear, hear!


Madam Speaker, I have a question for the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance concerning the food he has been feeding us for the past two months. It follows directly on the questions of my socialist friend from York-Peel, the ones he picked up from us yesterday concerning the problem of the rates being charged to consumers.
If the minister is serious in the answer he gave to the hon. member for York-Peel, when he said he will be vigilant in following the interest rates charged to consumers, the prime rates and the rates charged to small businessmen, could he please answer the question I put to him yesterday? Why have the Minister of Finance and the Minister of State for Finance specifically rejected proposals from this party which have been forwarded to him and which I am sure he has seen? They would give the minister the power and ability under the new Bank Act to monitor interest rates charged consumers and small businessmen by the chartered banks. They would give the government responsibility for assessing whether they are reasonable and whether excess profits are being made by the banks, in light of economic conditions.


Madam Speaker, perhaps the hon. member would be prepared to wait until the banking bill has come out of committee before raising these questions in the House.


He has rejected them in committee.


If I wanted to raise a point of order, I would have a valid basis against the hon. member in raising questions which are presently under discussion in committee.


What a joke.


I want to tell the hon. member that all the amendments he has proposed with respect to Financial disclosure-and I would gather this is part of his over-all series of amendments-are still under consideration by myself.


Madam Speaker, my supplementary question to the minister is no surprise.


The poor consumer.

June 13, 1980
Oral Questions


I look forward with interest to hearing what the minister has to say. My question to the minister follows the questions and answers that have been going across the floor of this House for over a month to his colleague, the Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce.
Considering the fact that Canadian cars are being sold in the United States with large rebates being offered by the three large car makers, and considering the fact that the consumer price index figures issued today show that the lack of such rebates in Canada is putting serious pressure on the consumer price index, can the minister tell the House what his attitude is regarding those rebates, when the three large car makers are offering them in the United States on Canadian cars and not in Canada, and when we have signed a deal on pricing?


Madam Speaker, to assist the hon. member with this very important question, and to follow up what I said in the House the other day, I had my officials contact the heads of the motor vehicle manufacturers to raise the question of rebates for cars in Canada with them.
They said that the market situation, as they saw it, did not lead to their deciding to offer these rebates directly to consumers. They have available, however, dealer incentive programs which, in their view, make available to Canadian consumers equivalent opportunities to the rebate programs in the United States.


Could you believe it?


A further supplementary question, Madam Speaker. We have the Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce accepting the word of the three car makers, and we have the Minister of Finance consorting with the Canadian Bankers' Association. We know who they are with.
I should like to put a final supplementary to the Minister of Finance. The fact of the matter is that consumer demand has been falling dramatically, that real disposable income has been falling dramatically, and yet we have this persistent and consistent pressure on the price side.
In light of these conditions, and in light of the fact that corporate profits have been so high and some bank profits have been so high, will the minister reconsider the historic rejection by the Liberal party of a proposal from us that the government establish a fair prices commission so that we can get at the root of what is causing this inflationary spiral even when demand is falling?


Madam Speaker, the hon. member has referred to my consorting with the bankers. One of the bank's presidents told me last night how much he enjoyed the luncheon he had with the hon. member recently.


Hear, hear!


Oh, oh!


He is blushing.


With respect to the very important question of policy raised by the hon. member, it is a matter that, if decided upon, would be announced to this House in a formal way.


Madam Speaker, I have a question for the Minister of Transport. In light of the disturbing news that many Ford Motor Company products have slipping transmissions which lurch into reverse from park, and that there has been a total of 291 recorded cases in Canada, with 41 serious injuries and four deaths, could the minister tell the House why there are no regulations on the books right now that would enable the federal government to force the recall of automobiles which are known to have defective parts?
Will the minister give the House an undertaking that the government will consider enacting legislation which would empower him and his department and the Government of Canada to recall automobiles with defective parts?


Madam Speaker, there is in the law authority to issue a notice of defect. I also indicated before that the department can inquire, can inform and can do all kinds of things around the phenomenon of recall.
As I said specifically, however, the department does not have the authority to recall; that is very clear. Why? Simply because the system as it exists has been sufficient in possibly 99.9 per cent of cases to obtain the result which is contemplated. So as I said yesterday, in instances of this kind I, personally, do not believe that the legal process should be used to reach an objective which can be reached through other means less dramatic than the legal one. But this is a subject for debate, obviously.


What is most disturbing about this case, Madam Speaker, is that the federal Department of Transport has been investigating these incidents since 1977. I and other consumers would be interested in knowing what other cases might be under investigation by the depart-
June 13, 1980

ment regarding defective brakes as we heard about in the Volkswagen Rabbit case, faulty transmissions, and so on.
In the meantime, I should like to know what advice the government can give to the great number of concerned Ford drivers in Canada until the government makes up its mind what to do about recalling these vehicles. Is any kind of an information kit being issued, for example, in conjunction with the Department of Consumer and Corporate Affairs?


Madam Speaker, I am interested in the subject, obviously and passionately. I shall have a kit developed myself and I shall send a copy to the hon. member. Communiques to that effect come across my desk regularly. This was the case in the Volkswagen brake incident. I will package something and send a copy to my hon. friend.


Madam Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources. In reply to my question yesterday about a possible one-year delay in construction of the two massive oil sands plants in northeastern Alberta because of lack of an oil pricing agreement, the minister said:
We are not the ones preventing those plants from proceeding. I am afraid the hon. member has the wrong information.
I would suggest that perhaps the hon. minister has the wrong information. Is it not true that the companies developing those massive oil sands plants must have a firm agreement on pricing before they can proceed, and that they do not have that from the federal government at the present time?


Madam Speaker, the hon. member should know that there is a firm pricing agreement. This is going to expire July 1, but there has been one in operation for the last few years. As recently as two weeks ago Alberta Gas Trunk Line and Petro-Canada announced an intention to build a third oil sands plant without waiting for a firm oil pricing agreement. They decided they wanted to proceed. They have confidence in this government, and the government of Alberta, that we will provide ample funds for them to have a financially viable operation. This is the view of both governments and it is shared by the entrepreneurs concerned.
They need, and are waiting for, formal authorization from the government of Alberta and from the various boards and agencies of that government. Various fiscal incentives have been asked for from this government over the years, and they have been granted. What is lacking at the present time is the form of authorization from the government of Alberta. The hon. member knows that that kind of answer has not been forthcoming in the last year from the government of Alberta, not from this government.
Oral Questions


Madam Speaker, will the Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources stand in this House and say that he has a firm agreement with Alsands on pricing, and that he has a firm agreement with Imperial Oil on pricing? Will he stand in this House and say "We have signed and we have a firm pricing agreement"? He should know that is not true, and that $12 billion in investment is ready to be put in place.


Question.


I will leave that one, Madam Speaker.


Madam Speaker, obviously the hon. member is more interested in making a speech than asking a question.


You invoked force majeure.


Madam Speaker, my question is supplementary to the one asked about the failure to recall Ford cars since there have been four deaths in this country, 41 injuries and, I believe, nearly 300 accidents. If I heard the minister correctly in the House today and through the media yesterday he said that his department has some power to do something.
As his department has known about the problems for a few years, and since it has some power, does the minister not agree that the government has some responsibility to compensate people who have been injured as a result of these accidents, and some responsibility for the people who have died as a result of them, at least equal responsibility with the Ford Motor Company which manufactures the cars in our country?


Madam Speaker, I would emphasize that the safety authorities in the United States have reached what is called a "tentative finding." This tentative finding must now go through the process of public hearing. In other words, up to now the possibility of the fault has been studied in both Canada and the United States but there is no conclusive evidence. Ford still disagrees with the tentative finding made in the United States.
In this case, in a number of occurences, it is claimed that an accident can be imputed to slippage of the transmission, but there is no proof that this is so. The figures have been added up and they indicate that there is the possibility of such a fault. But, I repeat, it is not a proven fact.


Madam Speaker, my supplementary question is directed to the Minister of
2078

June 13, 1980
Oral Questions
Justice. It concerns the failure of the government to recall any Ford cars despite the fact that four people have died and 41 have been injured as the result of faulty transmissions.
The Minister of Transport has said that the government does have some power to act, but it has failed to act despite the fact there is thought to be a problem. He is satisfied that there are no conclusive findings on the problem in the United States. I would point out that I am referring to cars which are made in Canada.
Has the Minister of Justice sought a legal opinion on this matter and, if he has not, will he seek a legal opinion to determine whether or not the government is equally responsible with Ford Motor Company if any deaths or injuries occur due to faulty transmissions, in light of the fact that the government has the power to put a stop to this matter and recall the cars, that it has known of this problem for a number of years and that this problem is causing undue hardship to a number of Canadians?


Madam Speaker, I have not received a request from anybody on this matter to this day. I will certainly examine the question. I believe this responsibility comes under the administration of federal laws in the area of transport safety, that is under the Minister of Transport. I will discuss this matter with the minister. But I have not received a request from anybody regarding a criminal offence.


Madam Speaker, yesterday it was implied in the House and in the committee on agriculture that the Minister of Agriculture showed favouritism toward Quebec in the administration of assistance programs aimed at several types of agriculture. Could the minister tell the House whether it is true that the stabilization program has assisted potato growers of Quebec?


Madam Speaker, wherever the stabilization program is used, it will be of some help. But there is no guarantee that it will be a profit-making apparatus. It is a program which, if used, would allow these growers to stay in business.


Madam Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources. Several weeks ago I asked the Prime Minister a question regarding the energy future of Canada and what the government's position was on the matter. I would like to rephrase the question and ask the Minister of Energy whether or not he understands, considering decreasing domestic oil supplies, the insecurity and instability of foreign imports and an inadequate and insufficient conservation and substitution program, that his policy is one of rationing and committing this country to rationing?


Madam Speaker, I certainly do not understand, for the very simple reason that that is not our policy. Our policy is to reach as quickly as possible a level where we will not be reliant on imported oil. This policy implies increased supply, better conservation programs and a whole series of policies to encourage Canadians to move off oil to alternative fuels.
I have already announced a policy, for instance, whereby refineries will upgrade oil in this country and whereby there will be greater access to natural gas. There will be savings of well over 100,000 barrels per day alone through the measures I have already announced. Our purpose is to achieve complete autonomy for Canada as soon as possible. There is a whole array of measures already in operation, and I hope to be able to announce further measures once an oil pricing agreement is reached, which I hope will be soon.


Madam Speaker, I understand very well the implications and the understandings. The inadequacy of the time-frames involved in all these measures to enable us to reach a goal where we will not require rationing, in fact, implies that the government has a rationing policy.
Does the minister understand the possible political frustrations and the frustrations among interested groups when rationing, no matter what form it takes, becomes necessary because of the short-term needs of oil in this country?


Madam Speaker, there is no rational policy- rationing policy.


Oh, oh!


Pardon me, Madam Speaker, I was thinking of the former Conservative budget.


After that first statement, your nose shrunk by two inches.


Coming to the present government, there is no rationing policy under consideration. As the hon. member knows, the Energy Supplies Allocation Board is working on measures, as are all other countries which are members of the International Energy Agency, to enable us to cope with a
June 13, 1980

situation which might arise out of an international crisis and which would create very serious problems for all western industrialized countries.
However, these measures are aimed at a very serious crisis of an international nature, and rationing is not a matter which is under consideration by this government.


Madam Speaker, my question is directed to the Minister of Agriculture, who during the early weeks of 1980 expressed himself as being completely and totally opposed to the excise tax as it was originally proposed by the hon. member for St. John's West. However, since he has been appointed to his high office, he has indicated that he would review the imposition of that excise tax.
Is the minister prepared to take some positive action to rescind that excise tax because of its oppressive, depressive nature and in light of today's announcement on continuing high inflation costs?


Madam Speaker, my opinions about that tax have not changed very much. I am currently having very detailed discussions with my colleagues in cabinet.


Madam Speaker, in light of the comment made by the Minister of Agriculture, I direct my supplementary question to the Minister of Finance.
Earlier, the Minister of Finance indicated that he, too, would review the imposition of that harsh, excessive tax as it is applied to the Canadian wine industry. Is the minister now prepared to say whether or not that review has been completed? The fact that the tax has been imposed is an indication that the review has been completed and of the disdain which the government holds for the Canadian wine industry and Canadian grape growers.


Madam Speaker, the representations which have been made by members of the government party, by the hon. member and by representatives of the wine growers, are still under consideration. It was certainly not my intention, in reintroducing the proposals of my predecessor, to place an undue burden upon the grape growers. 1 would be very concerned if any undue burden did occur. I can assure the hon. member that I am still considering the matter.
Oral Questions


Madam Speaker, my question is for the Secretary of State. Does the Secretary of State plan to act on representations made by the National Union of Students and other student bodies that students be given the opportunity to provide a more satisfactory input into the review of student aid programs?


Madam Speaker, 1 thank the hon. member for Kitchener for raising this question. It is obviously a question of great interest not only to university students in his home area of Kitchener-Waterloo, but also to university students right across this country.


Sit down, Francis.


Perhaps, to set the record straight, I should start off by saying that the previous Conservative government and the Council of Ministers of Education did not provide for any student representation or even any student input into that very important federal-provincial task force looking at student aid policies in this country.


Shame.


I had the opportunity of meeting with representatives of the National Union of Students on May 14 this year.


Oh, oh!


I would very much like to answer this question, because it is of great interest to student groups across the country.


Sit down.


It is obviously not of interest to the previous Conservative government or to the present members of the opposition. As a result of this meeting with representatives of the National Union of Students on May 14, I decided to raise the matter once again with the Council of Ministers of Education. I met with the chairman of the Council of Ministers of Education in Victoria on May 27 last to discuss this matter more fully.


Come on.


Sit down.


Order.


Oh, oh!


Order, please. I would like ask hon. members to allow the minister to answer the question.


Hear, hear!

June 13, 1980
Oral Questions


I realize, Madam Speaker, that it is very embarrassing to the previous Conservative government to recognize its lack of interest in matters concerning student groups in this country.


Order.


Order, please. I also have to call the minister to order. I would like him to answer the question.


You have over-pled your case.


I will be pleased to answer the question. Madam Speaker. As a result of this meeting with the chairman of the Council of Ministers of Education, the one-stage, no input process established by the previous Conservative government will be replaced by a second stage whereby the discussion paper to be produced by the joint federal-provincial task force will be made available to student groups, the National Union of Students in particular, in order that they may have meaningful input before any decisions are taken on matters of great concern.


Order.


Hear, hear!


Show a little respect for Parliament.


Order, please. All questions deserve an answer if the minister so chooses to give one. A question has been asked. We must have the answer, but I would ask the minister to be brief and to conclude.


This is an abuse of the House.


Thank you, Madam Speaker. My conclusion is that there will, indeed, be meaningful student input into the process following the publication of the discussion paper which will be made available to student groups in this country.


Order.


Unlike members opposite, who speak a lot about freedom of information but were not willing to make these discussion papers available.


Order.


Order, please. I do not know whether the minister has concluded his answer. I will ask if he has, and if he has then I will proceed to another hon. member.


Yes, Madam Speaker.


Madam Speaker, my question is to the Prime Minister of Canada, regarding the desperate housing situation on Indian reserves. In view of the fact that funds are urgently needed to build over 13,000 new homes that are backlogged, and that 24 per cent of the present homes on reserves are badly in need of repair, as well as the $12,000 per unit subsidy that is completely inadequate to meet current construction costs, will the Prime Minister assure us that additional funds will be allocated for reserve housing, as requested in an urgent memo recently to his cabinet?


Madam Speaker, I will be glad to take notice of the question and research that document to which the hon. member refers.


My second question is to the Minister of Employment and Immigration. In view of the appalling and disgraceful state of housing on Indian reserves, will the minister explain why housing construction projects are no longer eligible for LEAP funding, since this program was essential to build housing as well as to provide training and employment opportunities for people on reserves? Will the minister also explain why no program has been initiated to fill this void?


Madam Speaker, in answer to the hon. member, I would say that a program has been initiated. In this House just two weeks ago we announced a program of Canada Development Projects across Canada which will have special additional funds allocated for native employment.
As we indicated in the opening statement in announcing that project, if other federal departments want to put up capital moneys, then certainly the labour component of those projects will be paid for under the Canada Development Projects. These funds are certainly available to any group on a reserve to initiate a housing program under that arrangement.


Madam Speaker, my question is directed to the right hon. Prime Minister. In light of the
June 13, 1980

fact that Friday last he had the opportunity to meet with the leader of the Liberal party of Quebec, who is also the former president of the No committee, I imagine they discussed the list of subjects to be raised during the federal-provincial conference in September. Yesterday the leader of the QLP said that the list was nothing more than a draft which would have to be completely remade, devoid as it is of such fundamental elements as the linguistic and cultural duality of Canada and the existence of a distinct society in Quebec. Given those remarks, does the Prime Minister intend to accept the invitation the leader of the QLP made to him yesterday?


Madam Speaker, in his question the hon. member for Joliette said that he thinks the leader of the Quebec Liberal party and I discussed that list of priorities.
I can assure him that we discussed neither the list nor the statement of principles. I think the hon. member is making a mistake when he says Mr. Ryan stated that the list was just a draft. I rather think Mr. Ryan referred to the statement of principles. I, for one, do not contest such a description. I proposed it as such to the provincial premiers. It was a view of the federal government which I thought would have the support of a majority of Canadians but it certainly contains matters which are subject to discussion and amendment. That is why we gave ourselves several weeks during which the Minister of Justice and his colleagues will attempt to improve the draft.
As for linguistic duality, I think it is clearly recognized in that statement of principles and I would very much like to have the support of the hon. member for Joliette in that regard.


Since Mr. Ryan also admits that he has drawn inspiration from the Pepin-Robarts report, I do not understand how the Minister of Transport can remain silent, considering the apathy shown by the Prime Minister. However, taking the report into account the Liberal party leader has stated that he could not follow the Prime Minister of Canada since he wanted to base his constitutional reform solely on one peoples. Would the Prime Minister tell us today whether he intends to take seriously the recommendations of the Pepin-Robarts report, the comments made by the leader of the Liberal party of Quebec, the former president of the No committee, and refrain from making Canadians believe that he has a mandate following the results of the referendum on the matter?


Madam Speaker, the hon. member refers to the Pepin-Robarts report. The analytical and historic parts of the report indicate quite well, I think, the concept of duality in Canada. We have tried
Point of Order-Mr. W. Baker
to recognize that concept in the statement of principles to which the hon. member refers. We have spoken of the meeting of the French and English fact in Canada. We have also spoken about the linguistic duality. As for the term "people", unless I am mistaken, the Pepin-Robarts report nor any other rejects the concept of people. We must use a term to describe the inhabitants of Canada. Would the hon. member rather speak of the Canadian nation? Or would the concept of people be more acceptable? He should indicate a term to say that a population is living and wants to continue to live in this country. This is, as I said, what was decided by a majority in the Quebec referendum. The referendum did not deal with one term or another, but surely it indicated the will of Quebeckers to be part of a living whole in Canada and that normally there would be no objection to refer to them as a people.


Madam Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Employment and Immigration. In the recent labour force survey there was a notification that 68,000 jobs had been lost from the Canadian economy in the last month.
Can the minister tell the House from what sectors those jobs were lost, manufacturing or resource industries, what kinds of occupations, and what regions of the country were most affected by the job loss?


Madam Speaker, 1 would say to the hon. member that if he had read the second page of the statistical survey, he would have found the answer there. What they did point out was the jobs were lost primarily in the goods producing service industries, and were primarily in the province of Ontario. That is on page 3 or 4 of the labour force survey that was issued two days ago.


Madam Speaker, I hesitate to rise on a point of order, but I feel I must in view of what occurred just a few moments ago in the question period when the hon. member for Kitchener (Mr. Lang) directed a question to the Secretary of State (Mr. Fox). The hon. member can deny it if he wishes, and if he does I will have to accept what he says, but that was obviously a planted question.


Oh, oh!

June 13, 1980
Point of Order-Mr. W. Baker


Subject to his denial, I say that was a planted question. The minister had his music with him for the answer. That was bad enough, but, Madam Speaker, you have admonished the opposition, and we accept the admonishment because it is correct, for abusing the question period by giving long preambles to questions and motions under Standing Order 43. We accept that because the proper way for the question period to be handled is with as much crispness as possible.
It is important, if this question period is to mean anything, that answers not carry on the way the answer of the Secretary of State did. It went on long before there was any disruption or calls for order from this side of the House. When it goes on so long that it is not even a neighbour to crispness in its characterization, the Chair must intervene. Otherwise, question period will slowly and irrevocably deteriorate to a point beyond which it has already deteriorated.
We are prepared to accept your views or rulings, Madam Speaker, with respect to crispness in our questions, but when the Secretary of State went on and on and on in his answer beyond what could be considered a normal length for an answer, an answer that was abusive, political and all the rest of it as well as being too long, then we have to rise. Our only defence to that kind of process before an intervention by the Chair is to shout "Order", just as the defence to too long a preamble to a question or Standing Order 43 motion is to shout "Order" from the government side.
Madam Speaker, you need some assistance from the House with respect to this matter. I say to you now, as the House leader of the opposition, that we are prepared to do our best to assist you by undertaking that we will keep our preambles short. However, there is a quid pro quo in this House of Commons. We need some kind of assurance from the Chair, the government House leader and certainly from ministers of the Crown, who are supposed to be knowledgeable about the rules of this House and should not abuse them, that they in turn will help improve the quality of the question period.
If the Chair needs assistance, I want to say it will have that assistance from the opposition. It is important that some kind of undertaking come from the government House leader so that the spontaneity of the question period will not be lost. I say that with great seriousness. It is important that you intervene, Madam Speaker, and when you do you will have support for that intervention from this side of the House with respect to those matters for which we are normally responsible, namely the asking of questions.
I felt I had to rise and say that to you, Madam Speaker. If the hon. member for Kitchener tells me that his question was spontaneous, that he had not in fact consulted with respect to the question, naturally I will accept that. However, even if that is so, the answer was far too long. In fact, Madam Speaker, if you review the question, you will see that it could have been answered-


Order.


It could have been
answered-


Order.


Order, please.


That question could have been answered by a simple yes or no, with a short explanation. I think there has been an abuse today. The practice has to stop.


Madam Speaker, I am a little surprised by the intervention of the opposition House leader. All the more so because if the Secretary of State (Mr. Fox) did take some time to answer- and I shall come back to the nature of the answer he has given to the hon. member for Kitchener (Mr. Lang)-it is because he was constantly being interrupted not by the shouts of the opposition but by the screams of some members opposite. I could see the hon. member for Calgary Centre (Mr. Andre) who was behaving like a madman, Madam Speaker, and who was screaming to prevent the Secretary of State from giving a coherent answer. I find this not only childish but very disrespectful of this institution. That is the sad and poor image we project because of the irresponsible attitude of the hon. member for Calgary Centre with his uncontrolled screams.
I was present, I wa
