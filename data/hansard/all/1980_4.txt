Madam Speaker, I rise on a matter of urgent and pressing necessity under the provisions of Standing Order 43. In view of the fact that it seems likely the United States Senate may not ratify the Canada-United States east coast fishing treaty, and in view of the importance of this treaty to maritime fishermen, I move, seconded by the hon. member for St. John's East (Mr. McGrath):
That this House directs the Secretary of Slate for External Affairs to immediately get in touch with his United States counterpart to impress upon him the importance that Canada places on the early ratification of this treaty.


This motion requires the unanimous consent of the House. Is there unanimous consent?


Agreed.


No.


Madam Speaker, I rise on an urgent and pressing matter under the provisions of Standing Order 43. In view of the very serious state of the automobile industry in this country, as reflected by recent actions, including massive lay-offs and statements concerning the operations of the Ford Motor Company of Canada Limited, and Chrysler Canada Ltd., and in view of the imminence of a decision on the request for government financial assistance by Chrysler Canada, I move, seconded by the hon. member for Elgin (Mr. Wise):
That this House immediately order its Standing Committee on Finance, Trade and Economic Affairs to be set up, and the committee commence an immediate review of the state of the automobile industry in Canada and the request for government financial assistance by Chrysler Canada Ltd., as well as an over-all review of the obsolete and inadequate auto pact.


Such a motion requires the unanimous consent of the House. Is there unanimous consent?


Agreed.


No.


Madam Speaker, I would propose a motion, under the provisions of Standing Order 43, on a matter of urgent and pressing necessity. In view of the representations made during the recent election campaign by Liberal candidates in the national capital area, that employees of the public service of Canada who were laid off would be reinstated and/or retrained, I move, seconded by the hon. member for St. John's West (Mr. Crosbie):
That the President of the Treasury Board reconsider his position that the Government of Canada has no responsibility for its employees, and take such steps as are necessary to extend the priority status of laid off employees, as requested by the Economists, Sociologists and Statisticians Association.


Such a motion requires the unanimous consent of the House. Is there unanimous consent?


Agreed.


No.


Madam Speaker,
1 rise on a matter of urgent and pressing necessity according to Standing Order 43. Considering that the killer mineral, asbestos, is causing lung cancer in thousands of Canadians, I move, seconded by the hon. member for Scarborough West (Mr. Weatherhead):
That this House call on the Minister of Public Works to remove or seal in federally-owned public buildings all asbestos used as insulation, fireproofing, soundproofing, or acoustics, which is flaking, crumbling, or damaged in any way, increasing asbestos dust in the air.


Such a motion requires the unanimous consent of the House. Is there unanimous consent?

Madam Speaker, under the terms of Standing Order 43, I request the unanimous consent of the Elouse to present a motion dealing with an important and urgent matter.
Because in the course of the current constitutional debate the Francophones outside Quebec stand a chance of being overlooked, and because the former secretary of state, Mr. David MacDonald, had ratified an agreement providing for the setting up of a joint commission of the federal government and the Federation of Francophones outside Quebec, I move, seconded by the hon. member for Winnipeg North Centre (Mr. Knowles):
That this House request the present Secretary of State to reaffirm that agreement.


Order. The House has heard the motion of the hon. member. Under the terms of Standing Order 43, the motion requires the unanimous consent of the House. Is there unanimous consent?


Agreed.


No.


Madam Speaker, under the terms of Standing Order 43, 1 request the unanimous consent of the House to present a motion dealing with an important and urgent matter.
As the Quebec government and the former Progressive Conservative government had started negotiations with a view to allowing the Quebec government to put to use for farming purposes the land now standing idle at Mirabel-I think all Quebeckers will agree with me-and as the new government intends to adopt a more receptive attitude towards provincial objectives, I move, seconded by the hon. member for Provench-er (Mr. Epp):
That this House unanimously urge the responsible minister to pursue the negotiations as soon as possible.


Order. The House has heard the motion of the hon. member. Under Standing Order 43, the motion requires the unanimous consent of the House. Is there unanimous consent?


Agreed.


No.


Madam Speaker, I rise, under the provisions of Standing Order 43, on a matter of urgent and pressing necessity. Air service in northern Canada is inadequate and unreliable, and runways are often only long enough to accommodate the smaller planes which are more expensive to run than in other parts of the country. I, therefore, move, seconded by the hon. member for Skeena (Mr. Fulton):
That the Minister of Transport undertake a full review of air transportation services in the north, including a review of the Arctic airport facilities policy.


Such a motion requires the unanimous consent of the House. Do I have unanimous consent?


Agreed.


No.


Madam Speaker, under the provisions of Standing Order 43, seconded by the hon. member for Winnipeg-Birds Hill (Mr. Blaikie), I move:
That this House unanimously acclaim the new country of Zimbabwe, which will officially come into being as the forty-ninth country of Africa in a few hours time.
I further move:
That this House unanimously congratulate and send best wishes to Robert Mugabe that his new country, with our support, will have long years of peace and prosperity.


Hear, hear!


This motion requires the unanimous consent of the House. Is there unanimous consent?


Agreed.


Is there unanimous consent?
April 16, 1980

Who said "No"?


I have the honour to table in the House the annual report of the Auditor General of Canada to the House of Commons for the year ending March 31, 1979.
1 remind hon. members that under Standing Order 65(1 )(g) this report is deemed to have been permanently referred to the Standing Committee on Public Accounts.


1 would like to draw to the attention of hon. members the presence in our gallery of the Right Hon. Edward Heath, former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, whom we thank for his visit.


Hear, hear!


Madam Speaker, I would like to give notice of a question of privilege involving the Minister of Employment and Immigration (Mr. Axworthy) which I will be raising at the end of the question period.
OraI Questions


Madam Speaker, my question is directed to the Prime Minister: it has to do with his reply yesterday when he was asked about his government's position with regard to support for the Olympic boycott.
Given his confused reply, which subsequently had to be twice clarified, not only by his own office but by the Department of External Affairs-and, 1 may say, neither time very successfully-a reply in which he indicated at one point opposition to the boycott, and then went on to say that at the same time he had written to President Carter indicating that he would support him in the measures announced-which, I presume, included the Olympic boycott-will the Prime Minister now say clearly and precisely whether or not he supports a boycott of the Olympic Games?


Madam Speaker, I am not surprised that the department, once again, had to clear up the confusion in the hon. lady's mind.


They had to clear up your confusion.


My answer was that I had written President Carter in answer to a letter he had written to me indicating some further measures, which was made clear in a press release issued by my office about ten days ago after President Carter's letter had been received. In my answer, I indicated that indeed we were approving the various measures that he was taking in a general sense, and 1 indicated certain steps that we ourselves are contemplating.


Madam Speaker, the Prime Minister, of course, has not answered the question as to whether or not he and his government are supporting an Olympic boycott, which he seemed to indicate yesterday when he said he had written to President Carter in that regard. Perhaps he would like to re-read what he said. The Prime Minister has said on other occasions that he thinks such a boycott can only be effective if it is widely supported.
Given the fact that some 33 countries have now publicly indicated their support for a boycott, and that includes countries from Africa, Latin America, Central America, the Caribbean, the Middle East, East Asia, Europe and North America, seeing that 33 countries have publicly advocated a boycott and 20 others have privately advocated that to the State Department, whereas only 27 have publicly stated they are against it, will the Prime Minister now say when he thinks that Canada should take a stand on this issue?


Come on, Pierre. Come on, old slippery shoes.

April 16, 1980
Oral Questions


On the first part of the question, Madam Speaker, I want to explain once again that in this particular letter, President Carter did not raise the question of the boycott with me. He was raising-and this was made public at the time-the further steps that the United States were contemplating since there had been no recent movement in the Tehran situation. It is these recent steps that I was commenting upon in my answer to him.
Regarding the earlier question of the boycott, I made my position clear in the House yesterday, and 1 made it clear during the campaign. The boycott, in itself, will only be useful if it serves to show the Soviet Union and the Soviet people that there is, indeed, widespread condemnation of their invasion of Afghanistan.


Do you condemn it?


That will only follow, Madam Speaker, if the boycott question is handled in such a way that it does not show division in the western ranks-


Oh, oh!


Resign.


-and, particularly, it does not indicate that the 104 nations which condemned the Soviet invasion in January at the United Nations do not seem able to continue that thrust of condemnation. It is to that end that we have been working, and are working now, Madam Speaker, to increase the number of people who would, together, pose some collective action.


Boycott, or not?


A supplementary question, Madam Speaker. Given that the government had said that its new foreign policy was supposedly an active foreign policy, and yet we see no new initiatives-in fact, our allies do not know where we stand vis-a-vis Iran or Afghanistan these days-is the Prime Minister now saying that he is going to wait until after 104 nations have had their say, and that Canada will be the 105th? Or will he, now that 57 countries have declared their opposition to the games in Moscow, please state where Canada stands? Will he at least do that prior to the time Secretary Vance comes here next week to consult on this question, since I am sure he already knows the point of view of the United States on this very important question?


Get your courage up, Pierre.


No, Madam Speaker, I am afraid it is not realistic to hope that 104 nations will join in this collective action on the boycott. I think that perhaps more of them might have done so if the government to which the hon. member belonged had not made these very brave ultimata to the Soviet Union that they must be out by February 20 or else they would see what they would see. I think it should be obvious even to the former hon. minister of finance that this ultimatum-


How would you have handled Munich?


-by his government has not had much effect on the Soviet Union.


It is better than your pusillanimous behaviour.


Madam Speaker, the Prime Minister avoids answering the question of my colleague, the hon. member for Kingston and the Islands. Yesterday he was clearly confused with respect to the sanctions against Iran and the invasion of Afghanistan, in his confused answer.
I want to ask him today specifically whether or not the Prime Minister and the government endorse the economic sanctions against Iran as proposed by President Carter, as was done by our government, the previous government, before the Security Council on December 30, 1979? Does this government endorse those particular proposals?


Madam Speaker, very early in the election campaign I indicated that the actions of the then Canadian government had my support.


Madam Speaker, I recall very clearly-as 1 am sure many members of this House do-the statements made by the Prime Minister before and during the election campaign. I want to ask the Prime Minister if he has taken any bold initiatives with respect to Iran, as he urged on our government-particularly about getting on the phone within 24 hours-and whether he has spoken to President Carter. Also, has he spoken to the other members of the summit, led the way in getting sanctions and taken steps and initiatives with respect to the hostages in Tehran, or is he just sitting around and waiting until all the other nations go first and then he can come along?


Madam Speaker, the actions 1 have taken have not been bold, in the sense of those of the hon. member's party, who used them very boldly during the election campaign. But I have taken steps, and indeed our foreign minister is in Zimbabwe today following up on those steps and trying to get a little larger support for whatever action we take to condemn the invasion than the hon. member's government managed to do.


Hear, hear!


Madam Speaker, the Prime Minister is referring to the invasion of Afghanistan, I am talking about Iran. It is next to Iraq, and it is next to Afghanistan. It is a different country.
I ask the Prime Minister whether or not-he has made reference to these letters and communications with President Carter-he will now table those documents in the House of Commons. He has made reference to them. He is required
April 16, 1980

under the rules of the House of Commons to table these documents. Will he do that, so the people of Canada can see what he is doing, if he will not tell us?


Madam Speaker, I knew, once again, that the kind of bold action that the hon. member describes is not the kind that I would be able to follow up. I do not believe in trying to make political yards with this. I try and get-


Oh, oh!


Even MacEachen is smiling at that one.


Hear, hear!


1 find it more important to take effective action, and that is what we are doing.


Hear, hear!


Madam Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Finance. In view of the minister's insensitive statement yesterday that most Canadians can afford a home, and only a small number of home owners need help because of high interest rates, and since at least 32,000 home owners face foreclosure or must pay increased interest rates well in excess of 30 per cent of their income, will the minister take steps to ensure that mortgages renewed in 1980 remain frozen at their existing rate for at least one year?


Madam Speaker, I cannot give that assurance to the hon. member. There is no way that it would be possible for the government to freeze interest rates in these circumstances, or in accordance with the irresponsible suggestion contained in the amendment moved by the Leader of the New Democratic Party.
What we are attempting to do-and this ought to give some comfort to the hon. member-is ensure that home owners renegotiating their mortgages in this period of very high interest rates will be able, through techniques we are considering, to continue their payments and to maintain ownership of their homes. That seems to me to be a very sensitive approach to a critical problem.


Madam Speaker, I think the minister does not recall, but I believe in 1965 there were such controls.
Oral Questions


Madam Speaker, my supplementary is to the minister responsible for Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation.
Since new housing starts are down dramatically, while rents for about four million tenants are skyrocketing, and many pensioners and women raising families on their own are paying up to 60 per cent of their incomes on rent, and since the greatest housing need in Canada is to increase non-profit housing to lease to tenants who are earning less than $30,000 per year, will the minister responsible for CMHC tell this House how many requests for non-profit and co-op housing were refused CMHC funding this year; and will he confirm that allocations will be increased for this kind of housing?


Madam Speaker, I recognize the difficulties expressed by the hon. member opposite. I will need some time to get the specifics. However, I am pleased to say that we are aware that there are a number of demands. They seem to be numerous. 1 will report to the hon. member on the exact number when 1 have the opportunity, I expect tomorrow.


Madam
Speaker, my question is directed to the Minister of National Health and Welfare. Considering that the Speech from the Throne read by His Excellency the Governor General restates the government's undertaking to grant a monthly increase of $35 to persons receiving the income supplement, could the minister tell the members of this House whether she intends to meet her provincial counterparts so that this time, once the House has approved the increase, the provinces will not take it back from the elderly, especially those who live in senior citizens' homes?


Madam Speaker, 1 would like to admit that there is such a problem which deeply concerned the members who were in the House two years ago. A week or ten days ago, I believe, I wrote to each of my provincial counterparts to make sure it would not happen again, if possible, and I asked them specifically to increase the allowance given as pocket money to senior citizens who receive the supplement and live in such homes, that is, almost 10 per cent of all senior citizens. For example, I know that if Quebec were to act as it did last time, it would be taking $6 or 7 million from older people.

April 16, 1980
64____ _	____
Oral Questions


Madam Speaker, my question is to the Prime Minister, who last fall had a tiger in his tank when it came to foreign affairs: now he has not even got a pussycat.


Oh, oh!


At the summit meeting last June in Tokyo, which the Prime Minister missed-


Oh, oh!


-the real prime minister agreed that Canada would reduce its annual average rate of growth of oil consumption to 1 per cent by the year 1985, with the consequent reduction of oil imports by 50,000 barrels per day. That did not imply any agreement on oil prices.
Will the Prime Minister tell us whether he intends to keep to this commitment. If so, how is he going to keep to that commitment in view of his policy announced during the election campaign in connection with the oil situation?


Madam Speaker, surely the hon. member knows that at the next summit held in Venice the energy issue will be discussed at length and the Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources and myself are preparing the Canadian position on the matter.


Madam Speaker, the question 1 asked the Prime Minister was whether he was going to honour the commitment given by Canada at the summit meeting of last June with reference to our position on reducing oil imports by the year 1985.
Is the Prime Minister saying that he is not going to observe that commitment, that he and his Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources are going to make some different commitment. Furthermore, what is the Prime Minister going to do about the thousands of Americans who are coming into Canada to buy gasoline, saving $17.40 a barrel provided by way of subsidy by the Canadian taxpayer? When is he going to do something about that? How about an answer on both of those? What is his policy?
[ Translation]


Madam Speaker, the hon. member is well aware that this government will not promise to repeat all the promises the previous government had made here and there. The Clark government itself had to renege on several of its promises. The one about Jerusalem is a case in point.


Madam Speaker, my question is to the Minister of Transport. I would like to congratulate him on his appointment. Would the minister assure this House and western Canada that the infrastructure funds for development of the Ridley Island grain port in Prince Rupert will be made available at levels acceptable to an immediate go-ahead, thereby removing all existing uncertainties.
As I am sure the minister appreciates, grain farmers and producers in the western provinces view this development as crucial, because every day of delay is costing them and Canada millions of dollars.


Yes, Madam Speaker, I can do that. My generous predecessor committed $42.5 million to that objective. As is well known, however, some of that money was to come from the governments of British Columbia and Alberta. I had to ensure that it was still there unconditionally. It is.


What about Saskatchewan?


I invited the government of Saskatchewan as sympathetically as I could to contemplate making a similar contribution. The question of the wharf never having been cleared up-I think that is true-I informed the consortium that the wharf would be on a cost-recovery basis.
It can therefore be seen that I am trying to put together all the loose ends. I am convinced the project will go ahead, and I am dedicating myself fully to that objective.


Perhaps the minister will give an unequivocal yes or no as to whether or not the funds for the infrastructure costs will be in place before the end of this month.


Yes, Madam Speaker.


Madam Speaker, in the absence of the Secretary of State for External Affairs, I wish to ask the Prime Minister this question, in view of the very disturbing reports coming out of Washington that the U.S. Senate may not ratify the Canada-U.S. fishing treaty which is so important to the Atlantic provinces, and in view of the fact that two months ago there seemed to be a disposition on the part of senior U.S. congressmen, as well as Senator Church, the chairman of the Senate foreign relations committee, to get on with ratification of this treaty, 1 wish to ask the Prime Minister what steps the government took to take advantage of the good will that existed there at that time, in order to
April 16, 1980

impress upon the U.S. government the importance to Canada of ratification of this important treaty.


Madam Speaker, I was very distressed indeed to realize that ratification of the treaty was somewhat in doubt. The hon. member will recall that it was a previous Liberal government which put that treaty in place and negotiated it. I was somewhat disturbed to learn that so little had been done by the Conservative administration to follow up on that treaty.


My supplementary question to the Prime Minister is this: In view of the fact that the failure of the U.S. Senate to ratify this treaty could have very serious consequences on the east coast fishery, especially the very important scallop fishery, and in view of the fact my colleague, the former secretary of state for external affairs, made representations to Cyrus Vance and Senator Church, I ask the Prime Minister why this government failed to impress upon the U.S. government, at a time when there was good will there toward us, the importance of this treaty to Canada.


Madam Speaker, 1 am sure you recognize the element of rhetoric contained in that question. We negotiated the treaty; we signed it; we were ready to implement it. When we left the office of government, the United States were well disposed. Something must have happened during the Tory six months to cause this indisposition, and we are going to try to correct it.


Hear, hear!


Resign.


Madam Speaker, my question is for the Minister of State (Trade): it has to do with our business dealings with Iran. Can the minister indicate the current status of Export Development Corporation loans to Iran? Can he indicate if any of these loans are currently in default?


Madam Speaker, at the present time there are about $125 million in loans outstanding through EDC. I am not aware at the present time if any of them are in default.


I realize the minister may have difficulty figuring out the policy of his government toward Iran. Can he advise the House what instructions he has given to the Export Development Corporation? For example, has he instructed them to cease disbursing any further funds in addition to the $125 million in loan commitments that are outstanding?
Oral Questions


Madam Speaker, my colleague, the Secretary of State for External Affairs, has stated that our policy with regard to Iran will be announced within a week.


Madam Speaker, my question is for the Solicitor General. Would the hon. gentleman confirm whether it is correct that over 100 members of the RCMP have formed an association to establish collective bargaining in the force, due to dissatisfaction with salaries and grievance procedures? If so, what response is being made by the minister and the government to this initiative?


Madam Speaker, I have given a lot of thought to grievances within the RCMP. It is quite true there has been the formation of this collective bargaining association. I am giving it consideration because there has been within the ministry for a number of years an RCMP act in revision and under consideration. I have made this a top priority. That act contains grievance procedures. It was in the Speech from the Throne, and I hope to be able to bring it forward soon. 1 hope the members of the force will try to live with it and give it a chance before they consider abandoning it and seeking some other way of resolving grievances.


Madam Speaker, would the Solicitor General confirm whether it is correct that a larger number than average are now quitting the force due to low morale and dissatisfaction with working conditions?


Madam Speaker, no, I do not believe that is the case. There is a report in the papers today to the effect that a larger number than average are quitting in the province of Alberta. That is a fact; I have checked it. But the reason seems to be economic conditions in Alberta, rather than any particular problems with grievance procedures in that province.


Madam Speaker, now that the Speech from the Throne has indicated that the Solicitor General is proceeding with those amendments to the RCMP legislation which were prepared for him by the previous government, would he tell us why on March 9 he indicated that he did not intend to proceed with those amendments?


Madam Speaker, I do not know what the hon. member is referring to. I have never said we will not be proceeding with them. We are proceeding

April 16, 1980
Oral Questions
with them. 1 have made some important changes to them and I shall be bringing them before cabinet shortly. Members of the RCMP themselves, along with members of the House, will have an opportunity to consider them soon. Basically, they implement the recommendations of the Marin commission, but they are updated so as to take some current circumstances into consideration.


Madam Speaker,
I should like to direct a supplementary question to the Solicitor General. In light of his previous remarks, is he prepared to review sympathetically some of the outstanding grievances which have existed with respect to particular members of the force, including people such as McCleery, Brunet and a member of the force called Danch who did not have his court costs paid, despite the fact that he was successful in the Federal Court. Is the minister prepared to review these matters sympathetically?


I am prepared to review sympathetically any matter an hon. member wishes to bring to my attention.


Hear, hear!


Madam Speaker, I have a question for the Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce. In view of the fact that the contract between the government of Ontario and the Ford Motor Company-which was negotiated concurrently with the contract between the federal government and the Ford Motor Company-was tabled yesterday in the Ontario legislature and contains no clause which in any way gives Ford the right to restrict making public the terms of the contract, does the minister stand by his statement of yesterday that such a clause exists in the federal contract and, if so, why is it there?


Madam Speaker, I understand that a telex confirming Ford has agreed to the release of the agreement on the Essex engine plant is on the way. I am having the contract translated so that it may be available to the House in both official languages, and I hope to be able to table it tomorrow.


Madam Speaker, I assume the minister is familiar with the terms of the contract, since he has indicated he has studied it frequently. Is he prepared to tell the House what terms there are in that contract which guarantee the jobs in the province of Ontario which were supposedly guaranteed at the time the $68 million was extended to Ford?


Madam Speaker, my review of the contract indicates that the commitments contained in it related to the building, operating and equipment of the new Essex plant. However, at the time it was entered into, it was the expectation of everyone that those activities would be in addition to activities at the existing Ford facilities.
This has been confirmed by statements of the president of Ford of Canada himself, and this is why I am seeking a meeting as soon as possible with the heads of the parent company, as well as of the Canadian subsidiary, in order to urge them to reverse the decision announced yesterday with respect to the casting plant and to the lay-offs at Oakville.


Madam Speaker, my question is directed to the Prime Minister. In the past year, the Department of External Affairs and CIDA prepared two position papers outlining the major trends in international affairs to which Canada will have to respond in the 1980s. These papers were intended to be a base for a parliamentary review of Canada's foreign policy.
It is the intention of the government to release these objective, professional papers and provide a reference to the Standing Committee on External Affairs and National Defence, so that it may proceed with such a study?


Madam Speaker, I am not aware of the particular content of those papers, but I will take the question as notice and discuss it with the Secretary of State for External Affairs when he returns.


Madam Speaker, can I infer from the Prime Minister's response that he is in favour, in principle, of the Standing Committee on External Affairs and National Defence conducting public hearings, and proceeding with such a study, allowing input from Canadians, particularly those who are interested in a constructive and vigorous foreign policy for Canada in the 1980s?


1 have explained to the hon. member that I did not know the content of these papers, and I cannot assure him in advance that I shall make public all the papers which were prepared while his party was in power. I suggest that the hon. member himself would be opposed to that.
| English ]


Madam Speaker, my supplementary is addressed to the Prime Minis-
April 16, 1980

ter. We have heard since the election from the Secretary of State for External Affairs, as well as from the Minister of National Defence, that they do not believe reviews of their respective roles are required at this time. Does that represent government policy?


Madam Speaker, the subject was not discussed in cabinet, to my knowledge, but by way of a general answer I would say that 1 am in agreement with what the ministers are reported to have said. We do not see a need for extensive and fundamental reviews of those two areas of government activity.
Such reviews were undertaken, as the hon. member will recall, in the late 1960s. They were subject to some criticism by the public and, indeed, by the opposition at that time, on the grounds that rather than acting, we were studying. It is our intention in this case to act, because our studies have already been completed.


What about Iran?


Madam Speaker, my question is addressed to the Prime Minister and it relates to the grave difficulties which the government of Jamaica is currently experiencing in its financial dealings as a result of a recent conflict with the International Monetary Fund.
In the absence of the Secretary of State for External Affairs, my question to the Prime Minister is this: In view of the fact that Canada has been expected to contribute an urgently needed $8 million U.S. to a World Bank program giving balance of payments support to Caribbean countries, including Jamaica, can the right hon. gentleman assure the House that this needed Canadian assistance will be made available through the World Bank, and that other official Canadian aid programs will not be hampered by this financing crisis?


I will have to ask the Secretary of State for External Affairs for an update on this subject. As of a couple of weeks ago, I know there was an exchange between the government of Jamaica and the Government of Canada. The last communication of which I was made aware was from the government of Jamaica, indicating that there had been a rejection of the IMF approach and consequently it was asking us to hold back on any action for the time being.


My supplementary question is to the Prime Minister: it is of a slightly different nature. Considering that needed Canadian equipment produced for the use of Alcan in Jamaica, which they need and want, is now ready for shipment and is reportedly being delayed because of the IMF decision, will the Government of Canada take supportive action to
Oral Questions
ensure that such shipments are proceeded with as soon as possible?


I will be happy to take notice of the question.


Madam
Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Employment and Immigration. In view of the fact that on previous occasions, former Liberal immigration ministers have refused to issue ministerial permits permitting Timothy Leary entry into this country, what new circumstances presently exist whereby Mr. Leary has been given a ministerial permit, especially in light of the fact that one of the purposes of Mr. Leary's visit was to give his first Canadian commercial performance at a Winnipeg hotel in which the minister and his brother have a financial interest? Does this not constitute a conflict of interest, in which case the minister ought to consider his resignation?


Shame on you.


Resign.


Madam Speaker, I am very pleased that the hon. member has raised that question, because he has been guilty in the past week of issuing a number of public charges based on totally erroneous information which he has now repeated in this House. Let me point out to the hon. member, first, and to other members of the chamber, that it is not the purpose of the Immigration Act to provide for censorship of view in this country.


Hear, hear!


A previous minister of immigration, Mr. Nicholson, put forward a statement-called the Nicholson doctrine-that there should be no attempt to prevent Canadians from hearing a variety of points of view, whether or not they are controversial. Just because the hon. member for Winnipeg-Assiniboine does not happen to agree with the position of Mr. Leary does not mean to say he should not be given the right to come to this country. In fact, if we were to follow the rules as to what the hon. member for Winnipeg-Assiniboine thought was right or wrong, virtually no one would be coming to this country to present their points of view. I would say, Madam Speaker, that-


Order.


In direct answer to the question-


Oh, oh!


-let me say that on March 6 I was given a recommendation by the department, in which I concurred, that

April 16, 1980
Oral Questions
Mr. Leary be granted the opportunity to undertake a crosscountry tour and to be available to entertain in the cities of Montreal, Toronto and Ottawa. I concurred in that recommendation made by department officials, contrary to the statement made by the hon. member for Winnipeg-Assiniboine that we contradicted them.


Order.


Order, please.


Madam Speaker-


Order, please. A supplementary question from the hon. member for Winnipeg-Assiniboine.


We are not talking about expressing opinions; we are talking about a conflict of interest. Obviously, the minister has not read his guidelines. You are not supposed to assist your relatives. In this case, you were assisting yourself in a commercial venture. You also issued instructions at Winnipeg and other cities that this man was not-


Order.


If the hon. member has a question, will he come to it very quickly.


My question is: Arc you going to submit your resignation, or have you discussed this matter with the Prime Minister, to whom I have written on this matter? It is clear and simple that you have broken the guidelines of a minister.


Oh, oh!


Order, please.


The question there is really one of my privilege, because the hon. member for Winnipeg-Assiniboine refuses to listen to the truth. The truth is that I concurred in the recommendation on March 6. At no time after that-


Oh, oh!


Madam Speaker, do hon. members on the opposite side want to hear the truth, or not?


Oh, oh!


I do not think they do.


Oh, oh!


The fact of the matter is that on March 6, on an application from a Toronto law firm which was acting as agent for Mr. Leary, the recommendation was made. At that time, I received no further application or representation from anybody, including my relatives, concerning his appearance at a Winnipeg hotel. I learned about it probably at the same time as the hon. member did, by reading an advertisement in a Winnipeg newspaper; but no representation was made, nor was any contact made, about his appearance. The recommendation
was concurred in on March 6. The arrangement for him to appear at the hotel was on April 1, and there was no other communication in between time.


Hear, hear!


Order.


Order, please.


Madam Speaker, my question is directed to the Minister of National Defence.
Now that a decision has been made concerning the new F-18A fighter plane, could the minister advise the House about the program worth some $300 million to replace some 2,800, 2'/2-ton military trucks, and indicate at what time a decision will be made concerning this?


Madam Speaker, as mentioned by the hon. member, it is true that under the armed forces equipment modernization program, there exists a program to purchase military trucks. We are drafting the specifications and, as usual, we shall make sure that the economic and industrial spin-offs are shared as fairly as possible among all Canadian provinces, in particular Quebec.


Madam Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Veterans Affairs. In view of widespread support for the proposition that prorata pensions should be paid to widows of disabled veterans where the veteran's disability pension was below 48 per cent, and in view of the statement made to the media by the minister a couple of weeks ago that he was planning to bring in such legislation, can he tell us if it will be introduced in the House at an early date?


Madam Speaker, I am very conscious of the legislation to which the hon. member makes reference. I would also say that I am very conscious of the legislation brought in by the former minister. Much preparation has been done on this legislation to date. 1 will be making further recommendations, and I will
April 16, 1980

be speaking with my colleagues on this very subject at a time yet to be decided.


When the minister brings in legislation respecting the subject which I just raised, will he also be bringing in the long-promised review of the War Veterans Allowance Act, as well as other pieces of veterans' legislation that need to be brought up to date?


Madam Speaker, this is all under review by the department at the present time.


Madam Speaker, 1 have a question for the Prime Minister. The Auditor General's report, released today, recommends that the government co-ordinate its response to the recommendations in the Lambert report, the d'Avignon commission and the Auditor General's findings.
I ask the Prime Minister, has the government decided to vest the responsibility for responding to these reports in a single minister and, if so, who is that minister?


Yes, Madam Speaker. It will be the President of the Privy Council.


I have a supplementary question for either the President of the Privy Council or the Prime Minister. The Auditor General's report which was issued today devotes an entire chapter to the need for improved accountability and control of federal Crown corporations, as was recommended in Bill C-27 introduced by our government.
In view of the fact that while the Speech from the Throne recommends the creation of at least three new Crown corporations, and no mention was made of the intention of the government to reintroduce legislation dealing with Crown corporations in the Speech from the Throne, and no mention exists on the order paper of today, why has the government refused to take action to date or to give any indication of any intention to take action to bring improved accountability and control to Crown corporations?


Of all people, Madam Speaker, 1 would have thought the former minister would know the answer to that question. He knows that preparation respecting the responsibility and control of Crown corporations has been the cause of work by the Liberal government for at least two years, and that when his government took office, a draft bill-which was given to the then minister-was a bill that had been drafted by our administration. So he knows very well what our intentions are in this regard.
Privilege-Mr. W. Baker PRIVILEGE


I gave Madam Speaker notice of a question of privilege involving the Minister of Employment and Immigration (Mr. Axworthy).
At 2.15 p.m. today Madam Speaker tabled before the House of Commons the report of the Auditor General to the House of Commons for the fiscal year ended March 31, 1979, in which there are references to the operation of government. Earlier in the day, before this report was tabled in the House of Commons, there was delivered to the office of each member of Parliament a statement entitled: "Unemployment Insurance: Undetected overpayments in 1978 projected by the Auditor General of Canada, Statement by the Honourable Lloyd Axworthy, Minister of Employment and Immigration, April 16, 1980."
That was done this morning before the report was tabled in the House of Commons and during a period of time when there was a lock-up for the press and for members of Parliament, a lock-up which a number of members of Parliament attended. I do not know whether the minister attended or not. Perhaps he did not have any reason to attend. There is no doubt that he was not referring to anything else but the report of the Auditor General as tabled, because in the document which he delivered to all our offices in advance there was the following paragraph:
The Auditor General's annual report, tabled today-
That is in the past tense, "tabled today". It continues:
-estimates that Ul overpayments in 1978 may have amounted to $290 million.
It goes on to quote a number of statistics out of the Auditor General's report.
The fact of the matter is that members of the House of Commons who saw that report were subject to quite an appropriate condition of confidentiality until that matter was tabled here in the House of Commons. I think it is a matter that is quite serious. It involves two things. The minister's behaviour is a discourtesy to the Auditor General in the first place.


Hear, hear!


I do not know whether it has escaped his attention or not, but the Auditor General is a servant of Parliament, not a servant of the minister. That is the first thing. The second matter is that it is a contempt of this House, and 1 think a minister of the Crown should know better. I believe the minister should be required to stand in his place, apologize to the Auditor General and offer at least an explanation to this House of Commons and indeed apologize to the House for this contempt of this House.


Hear, hear!


Madam Speaker, it is unfortunate that, in the
70

April 16, 1980
Privilege-Mr. Hnatyshyn
enforced vacation period the hon. member has received since February 18, he did not take the time to read reports which were previously issued by his government when they were in office. If he had taken that time, he would have recognized that in October of 1979 the Canada Employment and Immigration Commission issued its annual report. Appended to that report was the Auditor General's report relating to the activities of the Canada Employment and Immigration Commission, at which time the exact figures and numbers that were contained were tabled in October of 1979.


Tabled today.


All the information relating to overpayment under the Canada Employment and Immigration Commission was contained in the report of the Auditor General tabled in this House in October, 1979.
The report that was issued today was simply to give members of Parliament the opportunity to understand a number of corrective measures which we have since introduced upon learning of those statements of the Auditor General. It was simply to provide information to members so that they would not rush off in great haste and make great charges, but would understand that work by this government has been done to take the proper remedial measures based upon the Auditor General's report which was issued last October by the hon. member's own government. I suggest that the member go back and read that report.


Hear, hear!


It was tabled today. That is sleezy.


Madam Speaker, I rise on a question of privilege at the earliest possible opportunity upon being apprised of a set of circumstances which affects the rights and privileges of all members of the House of Commons, their rights and prerogatives in terms of the dissemination of the broadcasting of the proceedings of the House of Commons. Specifically I refer to the fact that in the city of Saskatoon the provincial government, through its Crown corporation, Sask Tel or Saskatchewan Telecommunications, has in fact taken the step of jamming the transmission of the proceedings of this House of Commons to the citizens of Saskatoon.


Shame.


In terms of the responsibility which Madam Speaker has to articulate, and in fact to investigate and take steps with respect to protecting the rights of members of the House of Commons, compels me to raise this matter at this particular point in time. Apparently what has happened is that there has been the transmission, through the facilities under Madam Speaker's chairmanship, of the proceedings of this House to Saskatchewan which has been received by the
equipment of Saskatoon Telecable Limited. This equipment has received the signals and the intention has been that it be carried over the lines owned and controlled by Sask Tel in Saskatoon. What has happened has been an interference with that particular dissemination.
1 would be interested in hearing from the minister responsible, the Secretary of State and Minister of Communications (Mr. Fox), as to what attitude the government takes with respect to this interference and with respect to responsibility for and jurisdiction over broadcasting in Canada, particularly as it relates to the House of Commons. I bring this matter to Madam Speaker's attention as a question of privilege and as a matter which is under her responsibility in terms of the broadcasting of the proceedings of the House of Commons. There has been an interference in the dissemination of the proceedings here to the people of Canada. I ask for a ruling with respect to that matter so that there will be no further interference with the broadcasting to Saskatoon.


Madam Speaker, indeed I think it unfortunate that this situation has developed, one which has prevented people, particularly in the area of Saskatoon, as I understand the problem, from witnessing the proceedings of the House of Commons over the past week.
This question was drawn to my attention late last night. I must say that at first glance it appears to be a dispute between the cable company and the Saskatchewan Telephone Company. In any event, if Madam Speaker so desires, I will more than willingly put all the inquiry possibilities at the disposal of my department at the disposal of the Chair so as to get to the bottom of the matter, and to report to Madam Speaker.


Madam Speaker, in view of the absence of the hon. Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Clark), 1 simply want to rise to give notice of the intention to raise a question of privilege tomorrow arising out of the remarks by the Prime Minister (Mr. Trudeau) during the throne speech debate yesterday, which might be of particular interest to the Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources (Mr. Lalonde).


Madam Speaker, you have not ruled yet on the question of privilege which was raised by the hon. member for Nepean-Carleton (Mr. Baker). There can be no doubt that the reference was specifically to the Auditor General's report that you tabled today. Perhaps you, Madam Speaker, would like to take the matter under consideration and bring down a ruling tomorrow.
It seems to me that one of those responsibilities which you have taken on now is to enforce the rights and privileges of all hon. members of the House, and one of those long established in the history of our precedents is that ministers do not act in
