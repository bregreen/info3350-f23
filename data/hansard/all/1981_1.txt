Madam Speaker, today marks the fiftieth anniversary of the Commonwealth, a unique association of 44 countries of different racial, cultural, and economic backgrounds. At a time when the international community is engulfed in a crisis of mistrust and inaction, the Commonwealth has the facility to bring diverse nations together in harmony and good will. Therefore I move, seconded by the hon. member for Kingston and the Islands (Miss MacDonald):
That Canada renew its support of the aims and objectives of the Commonwealth, particularly the dedication of the Commonwealth to upholding human rights, opposing racial discrimination, and resolving the world economic crisis through measures to close the rich-poor gap in the world.


Does the House want to manifest its appreciation for Commonwealth Day?


Hear, hear!


Madam Speaker, in view of the fact that the lack of a Canada-United States fishing treaty will lead to overfishing and disorder, 1 move, under the provisions of Standing Order 43 and seconded by the hon. member for Central Nova (Mr. MacKay):
That this House views with regret and grave concern the decision of the President of the United States to withdraw from the United States Senate that part of the east coast fisheries and boundaries treaty dealing with fisheries management and quotas, a decision which poses a serious threat to the scallop and groundfish resources off Georges Bank.


Is there unanimous consent for this motion?


Agreed.


No.


Madam Speaker, news reports today confirm that the minister responsible for the status of women has been unable to influence cabinet to initiate an independent review of the Advisory Council on the Status of Women. He is reportedly getting pretty tired of dealing with women lobbying for changes in the Constitution and for changes to restore integrity to the advisory council. In dismissing these representations, the minister has also cynically observed that the women's movement, for which he is supposed to be responsible, is easily manipulated. Therefore I move, seconded by the hon. member for Kingston and the Islands (Miss MacDonald):
That this House calls upon the Prime Minister to relieve the present minister responsible for the status of women from his tiresome duties and replace him with a person who will have the confidence and respect of women and of cabinet.


Is there unanimous consent for this motion?


Agreed.


No.


Madam Speaker, I rise on a matter of urgent and pressing necessity pursuant to Standing Order 43. Since, on the eve of his visit to Canada, United States President Ronald Reagan has unilaterally scuttled the east coast fisheries treaty, on top of his approval of $4 million in new financing for the Garrison diversion project, his backing off on commitments given regarding the Alaska natural gas pipeline and his total indifference to the problems of acid rain, I move, seconded by the hon. member for Burnaby (Mr. Robinson):
That this House condemn these hostile and negative actions by the United States government and, furthermore, that this House send a telegram to President Reagan telling him that if this is an indication of his goal of a "close

and co-operative relationship with Canada", he might as well turn his plane around and stay in Washington.


Is there unanimous consent for this motion?

Madam Speaker, I rise under the provisions of Standing Order 43. During the constitutional debate the need for labour mobility between provinces was a goal of the government. Nonetheless, the federal Department of Transport, as reported in the March issue of COPA newsletter, is refusing to allow French-speaking bilingual persons from either New Brunswick or Ontario even to apply for work in air traffic control in the province of Quebec. Therefore I move, seconded by the hon. member for Central Nova (Mr. MacKay):
That all departments of the federal government be instructed to refrain from using geography as a basis of hiring practices.

Madam Speaker, the grain transportation authority was created by the hon. member for Vegreville (Mr. Mazankowski) when he was minister of transport, and served as a catalyst to help Canada achieve record grain exports in the previous crop year. The grain transportation authority has been without a co-ordinator since Dr. Elugh Horner resigned in October, 1980. Under the provisions of Standing Order 43, I move, seconded by the hon. member for Lisgar (Mr. Murta):
That the Minister of Transport show support for the Grain Transportation Authority by immediately announcing an immediate replacement for Dr. Horner.


Is there unanimous consent for this motion?

No.


Madam Speaker, this country is in a mess. We have a series of problems confronting the people of Canada.


Oh, oh!


We have an oil company rip-off, an interest rate rip-off, unemployment is at an all-time high, house prices are beyond the reach of the majority of people, and we have a government afraid or unwilling to take any action in one area in particular.


Order!


Under the provisions of Standing Order 43 I move, seconded by the hon. member for Beaches (Mr. Young):
That the government take action immediately to ensure that the pending agreement which will limit the importation of cars and trucks from Japan into the United States does not result in an increase of exports of automobiles from Japan into Canada and, further, that agreements be sought to reduce the number of exports of automobiles to this country for a period of time necessary to allow our domestic auto industry to complete its restructuring programs.


Is there unanimous consent for this motion?


Agreed.


No.


Madam Speaker, I rise under the provisions of Standing Order 43. Recognizing that U.S. President Reagan will visit this capital tomorrow, and noting that the people of Afghanistan, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Bulgaria, Poland, East Germany, Roumania, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia and the Ukraine, among others, are currently denied by Moscow the right to choose their own governmental and socioeconomic systems through force of Russian arms, I move, seconded by the hon. member for Portage-Marquette (Mr. Mayer):
That this House requests the Prime Minister to discuss this matter with President Reagan this week, including ways in which Canada and the U.S.A. can work effectively toward achieving self-determination for all people now behind the iron curtain.


Is there unanimous consent for this motion?


Agreed.


No.

Madam Speaker, I rise under the provisions of Standing Order 43 on a matter of urgent and pressing necessity. Whereas the Standing Committee on Indian Affairs and Northern Development has not met since December 3, 1980, and whereas there are many serious problems of extreme urgency affecting native people across Canada, i move, seconded by the hon. member for Prince George-Peace River (Mr. Oberle):
That the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, or the Prime Minister, immediately instruct the chairman of this committee to seek a reference from the Flouse to convene regular meetings forthwith.


Is there unanimous consent for this motion?


Agreed.


No.


Madam Speaker, because it has been over two years since Canada and the United States signed a protocol to amend the Canada-United States Migratory Birds Convention in a way which would recognize native hunting rights, and since this protocol has not yet been ratified by the U.S. Senate, and since the Canadian government has shown little initiative in this area over the last two years, either by pressuring the U.S. Senate to follow up on this promise or in introducing amendments to the Migratory Birds Convention Act in Canada so that Indians may hunt without being prosecuted, I move, seconded by the hon. member for Beaches (Mr. Young):
That the Minister of the Environment immediately propose amendments to the Migratory Birds Convention Act which would recognize native hunting rights, and that the Secretary of State for External Affairs strongly remind the United States of its 1979 commitment to change that convention, and also that the Solicitor General announce immediately a moratorium on the arrest of native people under this act.

Madam Speaker, I rise under the provisions of Standing Order 43 on a matter of urgent and pressing necessity. Whereas the federal government originally encouraged and enticed provincial governments and municipalities to sign contracts for RCMP policing, and now that the suggested increases are way out of proportion, some being near the 100 per cent mark, I move, seconded by the hon. member for Athabasca (Mr. Shields):
That the House requests the government to review the scale of increases in order to keep faith with the original bargaining made with the provinces and municipalities, and also to help combat inflation.


Is there unanimous consent for this motion?

Madam Speaker, my question will be directed to the Secretary of State for External Affairs when he has the opportunity to return to his seat.


Oh, oh!


I am just welcoming him to his seat.
I should like to ask the minister when was the government first informed of President Reagan's decision to abandon unilaterally the east coast fisheries treaty and, further, what immediate steps the government took, either publicly or privately, to convey to the Americans Canada's profound opposition to this move.


Madam Speaker, I was telephoned by Secretary Haig-I believe it was on Tuesday evening of last week-to inform me that he would be recommending to the President that the administration not proceed with the east coast fisheries treaty but that it do proceed with the east coast boundaries agreement. I think we did not receive notification of the President's decision in advance or, if we did, it was so close to the time of his decision that in effect the two came at the same time. I believe that was on Friday. We did not receive any effective advance notice of the President's decision, as I under-

March 9, i 98 i
Oral Questions
stand it, but we did receive advance warning from Secretary Haig that that would be his recommendation.
At the time Secretary Haig called me 1 expressed our profound regret and disappointment at this move, and said that it was not what we had hoped and expected. He informed me that that was true with his side as well, that he had been very optimistic when we had met that he would be able to get it through the Senate, and that it was with great regret that his special negotiator had informed him, after twice discussing it with all the relevant senators, that it was simply impossible to get it through the U.S. Senate. It was on that ground that the American government decided not proceed.
We did not accept the American action. We told the Americans specifically that we were not accepting it in the sense that we did not agree with it, that we protested against it, and that we were profoundly saddened by it.


Madam Speaker, I find it appalling that the minister did not make some public outcry, the moment he was informed of this news, as to how the Canadian public felt and would react to this very distressing move on the part of the American government. However, given the fact that his comments to Secretary Haig were not successful earlier on, can the minister say what steps the government is now proposing to take in the next two days at the very highest levels to persuade President Reagan not to proceed with the announced course he has stated with respect to the east coast fisheries agreement, or will the government simply resign itself to accepting the way in which the American government is proceeding unilaterally?


Madam Speaker, this was a unilateral decision by the United States without consultation with us. It has been formally announced by the President, and I am not sure there is now any margin for the United States to change that position, especially given the fact that they are only reflecting their belief that they cannot get this through the U.S. Senate and that they cannot get the implementing legislation through either the Senate or the House. We certainly intend to discuss this very fully with the President and to stress especially the importance of conservation of the fish stock, because likely the greatest possible loss in this whole matter is the loss to conservation interests.
It seems that American fisheries officials have not shown themselves capable of adequately protecting fish stocks. This is what troubles us more than any other single thing about the American decision.
We also have their assurance that they will not proceed to enforce U.S. law in the disputed zone against Canadian fishing ships. They will have what is called flag state enforcement, which means we will enforce the law against our ships, they will enforce it against their ships, and either of us can enforce it against ships from third countries. This will avoid the
possibility of a so-called fish war in which each side would be arresting the ships of the other country.


Madam Speaker, given the situation the minister has now described, what concerns me is whether enough has been done by the government in the past number of weeks to convince the new administration in Washington of the unanimous and intense feeling in Canada against the course it has taken. I cite as an example the fact that on January 17 of this year the Canadian press reported that U.S. foreign relations committee chairman Percy said, after discussions with the Canadian Ambassador, Peter Towe, that he, Senator Percy, felt that treaty changes "can be accepted with reluctance" by Ottawa. He was given to understand that treaty changes can be accepted with reluctance by Ottawa.
I should like to ask the minister what it was in his discussions with Ambassador Towe that led Senator Percy to believe that any changes to the fisheries treaty would be accepted by Ottawa, reluctantly or otherwise, and under what orders was Ambassador Towe acting at the time Senator Percy reached that conclusion?


Madam Speaker, I do not know the state of Senator Percy's mind at the time he made that statement. In fact our position to the United States all along has been that while we would consider a reduction in the duration of the treaty from one of perpetual duration to one of a limited period of years, say 12, which would probably be long enough to return the capital investment of the fishermen, we would not accept any other changes. In his conversations with me Secretary Haig said that he well understood that the Canadian government would not accept any modifications to the treaty and that that was one of the factors the United States was taking into account in deciding to proceed this way.
The hon. member knows better than most that this treaty was negotiated and signed by the previous U.S. administration, the one with which she was dealing as secretary of state for external affairs. She also had a singular lack of success in convincing the U.S. government to put this treaty through the U.S. Senate.


Madam Speaker, 1 wish to direct my questions to the Secretary of State for External Affairs as well. He states that what has happened is a unilateral decision, but in effect that unilateral decision was
March 9, 1981

based on a joint decision taken by representatives of the two countries. In fact the East Coast Fishery Resource Agreement signed on March 29, 1979, following negotiations that began in the fall of 1976, which is a long period of time, was designed to establish a Canada-U.S. fisheries commission to provide for co-operative management, and for access and entitlements to specific stocks of mutual concern. At the same time the treaty to submit the delimitation of the maritime boundary in the Gulf of Maine area to binding dispute settlement, provides for the submission of the case to a five-judge chamber of the International Court of Justice for a final decision on the placement of the boundary.
With that background I should like to ask the minister if, in his estimation, the United States is taking the boundary issue to the International Court in order to settle definitively that aspect of negotiations between our two countries before endeavouring to establish the fisheries quotas for conservation methods, or what is his interpretation of these actions?


Madam Speaker, the United States government is prepared to proceed with the boundaries treaty, I understand, which in effect underlies the fisheries treaty. When international arbitration is completed, to a large extent that will effectively settle the fisheries question because it will determine the boundary on either side of which enforcement by the relevant country may take place. The U.S. government believes that there will be no difficulty getting that through the Senate, with its reference to international arbitration.
In the meantime, the U.S. administration is undertaking to try some conservation measures through the New England Fisheries Council. We are told that will not be on the basis of percentages of the catch, as we would prefer, but the U.S. Secretary of State says that it will indicate some interest on the part of the United States government in the preservation of the fisheries. That aspect concerns us a great deal. We would like to see extremely effective conservative measures taken so that the result of this flag state enforcement will not be that fishermen from both sides will be allowed to plunder the stock.
Of course, if the United States is not going to be concerned about conservation, we can hardly say to our fishermen that we are going to restrain them. Then it is the fishing resource that will suffer.


I wish to direct a supplementary question to the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans. In January, 1977, Canada extended its jurisdiction to 200 miles seaward, and in March of the same year the United States established similar limits. When doing this the United States stated that the principal purpose behind its action was to phase foreign fishermen out of U.S. waters so that the U.S. fishing industry could expand.
Oral Questions
My question to the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans is this: since the United States claims that the March 29, 1979, agreement is inconsistent with its 200-mile legislation, as it guarantees Canadian scallop, herring and groundfish fishermen permanent access to large parts of the United States zone, which is not in a disputed area, is the minister now planning to review all of the bilateral agreements covering fishing operations of foreigners within Canada's 200-mile zone in keeping with the promise made on February 25, 1975, by the then minister of state for external affairs, who is now the Minister of Finance, that the federal government would have the right to reserve for Canadian fishermen that portion of the total resource which they have the capacity to catch in any given year?


Madam Speaker, I completely fail to see how the hon. member's last question affects the previous statement made. In fact, we took the approach that where the line was drawn in fisheries terms was not overly important as long as there was a management of stocks which responded to biology and movement of fish. As long as that possibility existed, obviously our preference was for the treaty as it was negotiated, with great difficulty, because there had to be concessions on both sides. We felt, from the fisheries point of view, that the treaty went a long way to protect the traditional fishing patterns of both Canadian and American fishermen, that it disrupted them as little as possible, and it would produce a management of stocks which would ensure good conservation. I must say the decision which has been announced by the United States worries us from a fisheries point of view in terms of conservation. Certainly I agree with my colleague, the Secretary of State for External Affairs, that if American fishermen are going to have unbridled access to Georges Bank, then we cannot ask our fishermen to restrain themselves.


Madam Speaker, my question is for the Right Hon. Prime Minister. It also concerns the east coast fisheries treaty. On several occasions in this House, through motions under the provisions of Standing Order 43, we have announced our disapproval of the attitude of the United States toward not ratifying this treaty. I might remind the Prime Minister that the scallop allocation to United States fishermen has increased from about 10 per cent in 1974 to over 40 per cent right now, which is taking away much of the income of the Nova Scotia fishermen.
In view of the visit of the President of the United States tomorrow and on Wednesday, would the Prime Minister give assurances to this House and to the fishermen in Nova Scotia that he will ask the President of the United States to impose a
8020

March 9, 1981
Oral Questions
management plan on the American fishermen fishing scallops and other stocks on the east coast in the area under dispute? Will the Prime Minister ask the President to impose on those American fishermen a quota which will conserve stocks for which Canadian fishermen, in an attempt to do the same thing, are willing to accept regulations imposed by this government and the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans?


Madam Speaker, it would seem that the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans and the Secretary of State for External Affairs have dealt with this matter in their previous answers when they indicated that conservation was one of the main preoccupations of this government, and when they indicated the United States administration had undertaken to negotiate, I believe it is with the New England regional council, to ensure that that council would adopt conservation measures compatible with the maintenance of the fish stocks.


With all due respect, Mr. Prime Minister, I will address this question to you.
It has been quite obvious that the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans and the Secretary of State for External Affairs in this government, in the previous Tory government and in the Liberal government before that, were unable to get those kinds of assurances from the United States. We were not getting any co-operation on that treaty through normal channels, namely, through the Department of Fisheries and Oceans and the Department of External Affairs. I think it is incumbent upon you now, recognizing the failure-


Order.


-of normal channels, that you ask the President of the United States to impose a management plan which will protect those stocks on the east coast. That is not being done now. Will you ask the President of the United States to do something.


Are you asking the Speaker a question?


Will the Prime Minister give an assurance that he, as the Prime Minister of Canada, will request that a management plan be implemented to protect the stocks and income of Canadian fishermen?


Madam Speaker, I must say the hon. member is misstating the facts when he says that this government and indeed the United States administration had not endeavoured to ensure that the negotiated treaty would be implemented. On the contrary, we had the assurance from the Carter administration that it would do its best, repeatedly, over a period of two years, to make sure that the treaty was ratified. Therefore, there was on the part of the preceding U.S. administration, our government, and the government of the Leader of the Opposition, an endeavour to obtain ratification of the treaty. What happened in fact is that the U.S. Senate has not ratified the treaty. This government is putting forward the importance of
maintaining friendship with the United States as the basis of the meeting which will take place tomorrow and the next day.
We are presuming that the United States President adopted this course, not because he wants to see an end to the profitable fishing for fishermen of both countries but because he is seeking in some other way to achieve results that are profitable for both countries. In that sense the House must recognize that it is not the U.S. administration that failed to ratify the treaty for the past two years, but the United States Congress. In that sense this government is once again putting the best possible light on the United States action and we are seeking, in a spirit of friendship, with the visit of the United States President to find a solution to this problem.


I would once again request that the Prime Minister raise this with the President.


Madam Speaker, I wish to address my supplementary question on a related matter to the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans. It is with regard to the west coast salmon treaty which is now in the process of being negotiated. It will require a great deal of co-operation, trust and good will on the part of both governments in order to become an equitable and fair treaty for both sides. In recognition of the difficulty in getting equitable treatment with regard to the treaty on the east coast, will the minister reconsider the position of the government which guarantees in perpetuity something like 4.5 million Fraser River sockeye and pink salmon to the United States? Will he reconsider the Canadian position on the west coast salmon treaty, which is based on good will?


Madam Speaker, in order to help the hon. member understand the previous question, under American legislation the United States Secretary of Commerce can intervene to limit the powers of the regional councils. That is the very question I expect to discuss with Secretary of Commerce Baldridge tomorrow afternoon. If this can be done and if the scallop stocks can be protected through this approach, we might avoid very serious overfishing, which is a threat that now hangs over us.
1 hesitate to link the future of the west coast treaty to the problem on the east coast. We have always resisted playing one against the other. This we will continue to resist. 1 suspect that on the west coast the negotiations are taking place with ongoing and frequent consultation with the regional councils and interested groups on both sides of the negotiations, Canadian and American. In that sense, there may be more hope. The hon. member knows that one of the aims of Canada in the west coast salmon treaty negotiations is to restore the Fraser River to full Canadian control. That remains our aim.


Madam Speaker, my question is also to the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans. Since the treaty has been before the U.S. Senate for ratification over the past two years, American fishing activity has stepped up considerably on Georges Bank. Indications are that this is continuing to happen. Given that stepped up fisheries activity by the Americans, and the fact that there seems to be an agreement with the Americans not to interfere with each other in the disputed area, apart from the New England regional council being asked by the President to manage the fishery, which is like asking a chicken hawk to manage egg production, does the minister intend to hold bilateral discussions with the U.S. Secretary of Commerce who does have the authority to enforce fisheries management? We have much more to lose if there is not some management of that resource. It is our fishermen who stand to suffer the most.


Madam Speaker, I will be meeting the Secretary of Commerce at 4.45 tomorrow afternoon. I will make one slight adjustment to what the hon. member stated. We all stand to lose if we do not have a decent fisheries management regime on Georges Bank.


Madam Speaker, I will direct my supplementary question to the Secretary of State for External Affairs. According to a Canadian Press dispatch, a note was sent to the Canadian government by the U.S. State Department last Friday. The note outlined U.S. government objections to the treaty. It is interesting to note it came from the State Department. We thought we had successfully negotiated a treaty with the U.S. government. Will the minister tell this House and the country what was contained in that note which he received on Friday?


I am not aware of any such note, Madam Speaker. I will check and advise the hon. member. There were rumours of another note on Friday, but not that I am aware of in that area.


Madam Speaker, I agree with the importance of the subject matter of the questions asked. However, I would direct my question to the Minister of Agriculture. It has to do with the plight of potato farmers, particularly those in eastern Canada. Can the minister inform the House as to his recommendations and the government's decision with regard to the recommendations of
Oral Questions
the stabilization board on the amount that will be made available to help in the 1979-80 crop year?


Madam Speaker, the Agricultural Stabilization Board announced a payment that would amount to about 70 cents per hundredweight. The maximum a single producer can claim will be
10,000	hundredweight. A family organization of two or three members could claim a maximum of 30,000 hundredweight. Payments will be made when the farmers apply for them. That covers the eastern region of Canada, the three Atlantic provinces, Quebec and Ontario. Applications must be submitted before the payment can be made to them.


Madam Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans. In reply to a question a few moments ago, the minister indicated that he hesitates to link the question of the east coast fisheries treaty with the circumstance on the west coast. In view of the devastating state of the scallop stocks on Georges Bank, and the tremendously precarious stituation with respect to Fraser River salmon, in particularly the chinook salmon runs which have been subjected to heavy overfishing, especially by U.S. fishermen and U.S. native fishermen, is the minister prepared at this point to couple these two situations and realize that we can no longer continue to put the west coast on the back burner until the question of the east coast treaty is resolved? Is the minister prepared to deal with both of these issues and address them, square on, with his counterparts who will be visiting here over the next few days?


As a former parliamentary secretary to the minister of fisheries, the hon. member knows better than his question indicates. He knows that negotiations regarding the salmon interception problem preceded by many years the situation which has arisen on the east coast as a result of the extension of jurisdiction. He knows the problems are very different. He also knows that, much as it might be tempting, it would not be accurate to put all the blame for the overfishing of chinook salmon on U.S. seiners of Point Roberts.


The minister recognizes the problem. He has admitted in this House that negotiations with respect to the west coast salmon stocks have been going on for a very long time, without any serious intent, I might add. Would the Secretary of State for External Affairs assure this House that the subject of the west coast treaty will be discussed during the upcoming discussions with his counterpart, Secretary Haig and, in particular, will he reveal to this House the extent to which he has been briefed on this very important question and the extent to which he is prepared to put positive options on

Oral Questions
management before the Secretary, regarding both the west coast and east coast treaty, in order that we can prevent overfishing and ensure that we do not destroy both of these valuable resources?


Madam Speaker, that is certainly one of the issues we will discuss with officials of the U.S. government if we have time. Those who are involved in negotiations with the United States on west coast problems feel that these negotiations are going fairly well at the present time.


Madam Speaker, my question is for the minister responsible for the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation and it concerns shelter allowances and rental controls.
The minister announced outside the housing conference held this past weekend that he intends to introduce a shelter allowance program which will cost close to $400 million. We know the minister advocates the abolition of rent controls, and I should like to ask him whether he intends to plan to use shelter allowances as a means of doing away with rent controls and, in addition, who will benefit from these shelter allowances? How does he intend to prevent rent gouging by landlords if there are no rent controls?


Madam Speaker, part of the question by the hon. member dealing with rent controls was directed to the wrong minister. It should be directed, so far as my province is concerned, for example, to the minister for housing for the province of Ontario. I realize there is some controversy. This was an item on the agenda of the all-sector conference and there are a variety of opinions on the matter of rent controls. I appreciate from a Globe and Mail report of Friday last that there is some question about what is the position of the Conservative Party in this regard, but I would submit that the hon. lady should address her question to the minister with jurisdiction.


Madam Speaker, my supplementary question is directed to the same minister who was very vocal, according to my copy of the Toronto Star of March 2, about ending rent controls.
We know that in some instances shelter allowances are certainly needed by low-income people provided rents are controlled. However, shelter allowances will not build affordable housing and we need many more housing units. Therefore, will the minister tell us where the $400 million will come from in his budget? I hope this will be additional money. Will he assure the many concerned housing groups represented at this conference and across Canada that this money will not be
taken from the budget, particularly that portion which is so desperately needed to build non-profit housing and also for community service grants?


Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member for the opportunity of making reference to the all-sector conference on housing held here over the weekend. She gives me the opportunity of pointing out in response to a specific question that there were approximately 20 items on the agenda of what was an all-sector conference. Many people had the opportunity of commenting on many of the suggestions made, including one of the suggestions in my remarks to the effect that shelter allowances could be an additional and useful instrument in the response of governments generally to housing problems in Canada. The idea or proposal was introduced in my remarks in that framework, that is, to elicit response from the provinces and from all the sectors involved, including the non-profit sector to which she has referred.


Madam Speaker, 1 direct my question to the Minister of Transport.
The principle of mobility has been a long held goal of the government. However, the Department of Transport has now restricted applicants for the position of air traffic controller in Montreal to the "geographical boundaries of the province of Quebec". Will the minister tell the House how he can possibly rule out candidates from New Brunswick, Nova Scotia or Ontario who are bilingual, and particularly those whose first language is French? Is this not the worst form of discrimination and contrary to all federal guidelines?


Madam Speaker, I was also quite shocked when I was made aware of that situation and I want to agree with my hon. friend on that matter. I am told, however, that this is not uncommon. I have asked my officials to look into it further and to suggest ways in which it could be changed. I will report to my hon. friend as soon as I have a decision on that.


Madam Speaker, 1 direct my question to the Solicitor General. Last Friday I asked the Acting Solicitor General about the government's plans to move the headquarters of "E" Division of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police out of the city of Victoria. I understand the Solicitor General has informed the media that this projected move is by no means certain. However, RCMP
March 9, 1981

senior officers have said the move is on. Would the Solicitor General clarify this matter, please?


Madam Speaker, if the hon. member would tell me which members of the RCMP were saying that, I will get in touch with them and tell them the move is not on, not finally settled, and will not be until 1 have had an opportunity to discuss this with the provincial attorney general.


Certainly, Madam Speaker, the minister's request is about the last one I would answer. Will he get in touch with the mayors of the various municipalities affected? He will find a letter on his desk today or tomorrow from the mayor of Victoria requesting that the decision be deferred until there has been discussion with municipal officials. It also points out that "we have not had the benefit of any consultation with your local officials aside from a simple announcement that such a move is to take place". Will the minister assure the House that there will be impact studies done on this move before it takes place or is rejected completely?


Madam Speaker, I will not undertake that there will be specific impact studies undertaken, but I will tell the hon. member that a policing analysis was done of the situation, and from the point of view of cost and efficiency the RCMP is satisfied it would be preferable to operate its B.C. headquarters in Vancouver. That is not a decision which will be made until I have consulted on the matter with the attorney general of British Columbia.


Madam Speaker, 1 am more aware than some of the very real security problems that will be encountered round Parliament Hill tomorrow and Wednesday with the impending visit of President Reagan. I would direct my question to the Prime Minister. I apologize for directing it to him but, as the House will appreciate, the Chair cannot be questioned in this House.
In view of the instructions issued that no one, but no one, is to be allowed access, not only to these buildings, but to the grounds, tomorrow and Wednesday, unless they have a parliamentary identification card, who is to preserve the right of the Canadian citizen and taxpayer to have easy access to members of Parliament and their offices over the next two days?


How about members without identification cards?


Madam Speaker, I will take notice of the question.
Oral Questions


Madam Speaker, I wonder if the Solicitor General will tell us if he or the RCMP has issued any instructions actually to keep people out of the parliamentary grounds tomorrow and Wednesday?


I am not aware of any such instruction, Madam Speaker. I can assure the House that the RCMP does have a mandate to be responsible for the security of visiting heads of state and their suites. They are aware of that responsibility and they will be exercising it.


Madam Speaker, my question is directed to the Right Hon. Prime Minister or the Solicitor General. On February 23 the Prime Minister agreed to look into and report to the House regarding statements made by Mr. Paul Croft, who was a spokesman for the correctional service, and who, when asked how many natives worked for his service, said he would not be able to give that information as it would be violating human rights, but when asked how many natives were serving time in prisons said 840 were inmates, or almost 9 per cent of the federal prison population were natives. Is the Prime Minister now ready to report on that very hypocritical and blatant statement?


Madam Speaker, we do not know how many natives are working for the correctional services of Canada because under our human rights policy we are not allowed to ask applicants for employment with the correctional services of Canada their ethnic or racial background. So, we have no way of knowing from our records exactly what number are working for the correctional services. Obviously there are a number, but we have no statistical data which would show the precise number.
As far as inmates are concerned, human rights employment legislation is irrelevant. We have programs directed toward native people who are inmates in correctional centres, and to their needs. We have very full statistics on that. When we are asked about statistics on inmate populations we can produce it, but we do not have statistics about the racial background of employees of the correctional services of Canada.


Madam Speaker, I have never been in prison, so I did not know information as to racial origin had to be put on an application to get into prison.

Madam Speaker, my supplementary question is directed to the minister responsible for fitness and amateur sport. He will know that over 100 people will lose their jobs and that many native communities will be deprived of much-needed sports programs as a result of the government decision to cut off funding for the native sport and recreation program. Could the minister advise the House as to which department the money allocated for this program has now been directed, for what other programs will this money be spent, or will it now be spent to beef up the import compensation program of the Department of Energy, Mines and Resources?


Madam Speaker, as the House has previously been informed, the program to which the hon. member referred was an experimental program rather than a permanent one. The difficulty encountered in relation to my department was due to the small nature of the department and the fact that we do not have people in most centres across the country. It was impossible to have the program monitored and constantly followed. Consequently, there was a decision that the money could be better spent to the advantage of our native people through some other program. The determination of that program and what department would undertake it would be one which would not fall under my department.


Madam Speaker, my question is directed to the Prime Minister. In view of the fact that acid rain emissions in Canada have been considerably reduced-in the Sudbury region they have actually declined by over 80 per cent since 1970-but in the United States emissions have climbed alarmingly, and all forecasts strongly indicate there will be much higher S02 emissions this year and in subsequent years, will the Prime Minister assure the House he will tell, not ask. President Reagan of the United States to reduce drastically acid precipitation now?


Madam Speaker, the subject matter will certainly be discussed with the President of the United States.


Madam Speaker, I strongly suspect that we may lose out in that discussion. What sanctions does the Prime Minister have in mind to use against the United States in the event that the United States under President Reagan refuses to go along with the clean air memorandum of intent of August 5, 1980? For example, would he threaten to reduce or cut off hydroelectric power to the United States?


Madam Speaker, contrary to the hon. member's party, we are going into these meetings with the President of the United States with the presumption that many of these problems can be settled, as they should be, between neighbours; not by threat.


Hear, hear!


Madam Speaker, I have a brief question for the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, returning to the important matter of the fisheries treaty between our two countries. I should like to ask him about the effect on marketing if this impasse continues. Unless there is some solution, is it his view that present conditions could lead to overproduction and a consequent weakening in Canadian markets as far as our fishermen are concerned? Is this a likely consequence?


Madam Speaker, I wish the situation were such that scallop stocks would continue to be as healthy as they once were. The reality is that there has already been overfishing by the American industry, and we have responsibly held back our fishermen.
As I said, if we have to unbridle our fishermen, I am afraid that scallop prices on the contrary will keep going up as stocks become scarcer. In the long run no one will really benefit from this situation.


Madam Speaker, I should like to ask the minister another brief question. In his opinion, where does he feel the leverage is in this respect? Since the Americans take so much of the production of our fishing industry, particularly on the east coast, is the leverage with us or with them if the conditions as far as the treaty is concerned cannot be resolved?


Madam Speaker, I am afraid the answer would be too long for question period. The reality is that there is almost a philosophical difference between the Canadian fishing industry-fishermen, the processors and government- and the American ones. We believe in rather tight regulation of stocks and tight conservation measures. This does not appear to be the philosophy on the other side. Hopefully it will become that, otherwise the stocks will be ruined.


Madam Speaker, my question is directed to the Minister of National
March 9, 1981

Defence. On December 19, 1980, the chairman of the Standing Committee on External Affairs and National Defence tabled the committee report on NORAD. Does the minister concur with its recommendations? Has he briefed the Prime Minister prior to his discussions with President Reagan?


Madam Speaker, I can assure the hon. member that we will have discussions with the President or the U.S. Secretary of State. We agree entirely with the SCEAND recommendations and they will be brought forward for signature when the President is here.


Madam Speaker, my supplementary question is directed to the Prime Minister. The last three recommendations in the report indicate the change in nature of the NORAD relationship as technology moves from land-based radar to space-based radar. Recommendation No. 11 suggests that Canada should participate in this new technology. Is it the intention of the Prime Minister to discuss the changing nature of NORAD and, in particular, to place a new emphasis upon Canada's participation in the development of space based surveillance systems?


Madam Speaker, as the hon. member just mentioned, it is true that research and development are part of this agreement and that the name has been changed to that effect, changing the wording to "aerospace".


Madam Speaker, my question is directed to the Minister of Transport. It concerns the grain transportation authority which was set up by his predecessor. The minister will know that the Grain Transportation Authority has been without a director since the previous one resigned on October 15. Has he had a chance to consider a replacement? Is he in a position either to announce who will be replacing Dr. Horner, or to give us some kind of a timetable as to when we might look for a replacement?


Madam Speaker, the institution is continuing; Treasury Board has approved the necessary money to continue it. Mr. Radke is acting co-ordinator on an interim basis, and I am looking for the pearl who should be placed in that job.


Madam Speaker, if the minister's predecessor could not only negotiate guidelines for the transportation authority but name a director in five months, it would seem reasonable that the minister could find a replacement for him in five months.
I thank the minister for his reassurance that he is supporting the Grain Transportation Authority. Is he in a position to announce what type of goals the entire transportation system

can be looking at in terms of increased exports? Very early on in his ministry, the previous minister announced that he would be looking at a 20 per cent increase, and I have not heard any announcement of any increases by this minister. Could he give us an idea as to what kind of increases we should be anticipating?


Madam Speaker, I look at the figures every day. Unloading in Thunder Bay and Vancouver on the west coast is up 4 per cent or 5 per cent over the previous year. This gives an indication of the success of the grain industry at this time.
I am not aware that the Minister of State responsible for the Wheat Board has indicated any percentage, but I will discuss it with him and I will bring that to the attention of the House.


Madam Speaker, in answer to a question from one of the Conservative members, the Secretary of State for External Affairs (Mr. MacGuigan) made reference to diplomatic notes. This was in the context of fisheries notes. What was omitted from his answer was that there may have been another diplomatic note.
While there are rumours about there being a diplomatic note from the government of the United States protesting the national energy policy, I wonder if the minister, in answer to my question of privilege, could clear up for members of the House whether he was referring to that other diplomatic note?


Order, please. I am afraid this is not a question of privilege which can be raised at this time. If the hon. member has queries with respect to answers which have been given in the House, he can ask questions during subsequent question periods.
