Madam Speaker, I rise under the provisions of Standing Order 43. Considering the misleading statement by the Minister of State for Science and Technology (Mr. Roberts) on January 19, 1981, in which he pretended to confirm the higher, but still inadequate goal of 1.5 per cent of gross national product spending on research in Canada by 1985, while in the same statement announcing that the government's share would be cut by some 7 per cent, to the serious and even critical detriment of the entire scientific and research community and to young Canadian students and would-be scientists on whom the country must depend for technological innovation, creativeness and scientific, economic and social development, I move, seconded by the hon. member for Cariboo-Chilcotin (Mr. Greenaway):
That the minister live up to the promise he made in this House to support fully the previous Conservative government's five-year funding plan for research, or admit his duplicitous statement and position that as minister responsible for science and technology he is unable to fulfil his responsibilities and obligations.


Is there unanimous consent for this motion?


Agreed.


No.


Madam Speaker, I too rise under the provisions of Standing Order 43. The Small Business Development Bond program introduced in the budget of the hon. member for St. John's West (Mr. Crosbie), as everyone knows, has since been watered down considerably by the Grits. In response to my request last week to expand the program in order to include venture capital, the Minister of Finance (Mr. MacEachen) said in this House, "Any extended provisions to the SBDB would be an expense we cannot bear."
In light of new information revealed in a study by the Canadian Federation of Independent Businesses that this program will contribute $77 million to the federal treasury in the first year alone, obviously dispelling the minister's excuse, I move, seconded by the hon. member for Mississauga South (Mr. Blenkarn):
That this House instruct the Minister of Finance to extend forthwith the provisions of the Small Business Development Bonds to include venture capital so necessary to the very survival of the small business sector.


Is there unanimous consent for this motion?


Agreed.


No.


Madam Speaker, I too rise under the provisions of Standing Order 43 to raise a matter of urgent and pressing necessity. In view of the inability of local environmental groups in the Niagara area to halt SCA Chemical dumping into the Niagara River, and in light of the International Joint Commission's recommendation that such further dumping be discontinued, I move, seconded by the hon. member for Western Arctic (Mr. Nickerson):
That the Prime Minister be condemned for failing to follow through with his election promise made over a year ago that he would urge the U.S. government to deny SCA permission to dump into the Niagara River.


Is there unanimous consent for this motion?


Agreed.


No.


Madam Speaker, I rise pursuant to Standing Order 43 to move a motion which I

February 19, 1981
believe has the general support and, perhaps, the unanimous support of the House.
In view of the controversy occurring in Winnipeg over the recent suspension of three girls from their respective hockey teams and subsequent threats of suspension toward their coaches for playing them anyway, I move, seconded by the hon. member for Winnipeg North Centre (Mr. Knowles):
That this House encourages the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association to be more flexible and, in all fairness, to allow girls like Heather Kramble from the Pirates Community Club in Transcona to play out the season with a view to sorting this problem out between seasons, and not now at the expense of the girls and their teams.


Hear, hear!


Is there unanimous consent for this motion?


Agreed.


No.


Who said no?


Regan said no.


The Tories said no.


Oh, oh!


There were noes, and I am the one who hears the noes.


Who said no?


I would be grateful to the House if hon. members would let the hon. member for Athabasca (Mr. Shields) speak.


Oh, oh!


There is no point in indicating where the noes came from; I am the only one who knows.


Hear, hear!


Madam Speaker, I rise under the provisions of Standing Order 43 on a matter of urgent and pressing necessity. Whereas the head of the Economic Council of Canada, Mr. David Slater, has predicted that, even with moderate growth in the demand for energy, Canada will need another five energy megaprojects in addition to Syncrude, Alsands and Cold Lake, in order to achieve oil self-sufficiency by 1990, I move, seconded by the hon. member for Prince George-Peace River (Mr. Oberle):
That this House direct the Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources to demonstrate, as the minister said, "some spirit of flexibility and compromise" so that an energy agreement can be reached in the very near future with the province of Alberta, thus allowing several important oil sands megaprojects to proceed immediately.


Is there unanimous consent for this motion?


Agreed.


No.


Madam Speaker, I rise on a matter of urgent and pressing necessity. This week Mr. Robert Blair, president of Nova Corporation, declared in a speech given in Toronto that the federal government was entitled to a larger share of oil revenue. I move, seconded by the hon. member for London-Middlesex (Mr. Bloomfield):
That this House urge Mr. Blair to reiterate his wise statements at public forums in Alberta and in direct representation to the Premier of Alberta.


Hear, hear!


Is there unanimous consent for this motion?


Agreed.


No.


Madam Speaker, I rise under the provisions of Standing Order 43. In view of the fact that problems of postal delivery have deteriorated to epidemic and crisis proportions, and in view of the fact that the Guernsey post office in the Channel Islands has stated:
We have, however, been warned by the British post office that the Canadian postal administration is not one of the most efficient in the world! We were advised that a reply could take at least six months, and this is in fact proving to be the case.
I move, seconded by the hon. member for Prince George-Peace River (Mr. Oberle):
That the Postmaster General make a statement on motions explaining his abdication of responsibility in this very important communications department, and also negotiate with the Minister of National Health and Welfare that post-dated pension cheques be mailed two weeks earlier than at the present time so that pensioners need not suffer because of late delivery.


Is there unanimous consent for this motion?
February 19, 1981


Agreed.


No.


Madam Speaker, under the provisions of Standing Order 43, seconded by the hon. member for Winnipeg North Centre (Mr. Knowles), I move:
That this House note the timely tribute that is being paid tonight and for the next two days in my home province of British Columbia, in Vancouver, to Frank R. Scott, a poet, lawyer and academic, born in the province of Quebec 81 years ago, who has constantly stood for human rights and justice and who has been a unifying influence in French and English Canada and who, in poetry, has dramatized our basic tensions in the Canadian tradition, and who in law, Madam Speaker, has expressed his strong social concerns.


Hear, hear!


I see that the House does want to pay tribute to this remarkable personality. However, this is not a motion that I can accept under Standing Order 43.


Madam Speaker, given the absence of objection from the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans (Mr. LeBlanc) to the new Fisheries regulations for the west coast being considered in the Standing Committee on Fisheries and Forestry, on the basis of an order of reference, I am encouraged to believe that I shall obtain unanimous consent of the House to a motion of urgent and pressing necessity. In light of the adverse economic consequences of the new regulations on fisheries and the tourist industry on the west coast, I move, seconded by the hon. member for Richmond-South Delta (Mr. Siddon):
That the Standing Committee on Fisheries and Forestry be provided immediately with an order of reference to permit it to meet, examine the new west coast Fisheries regulations, and report.


Is there unanimous consent for this motion?


Agreed.


No.
Oral Questions


Madam Speaker, my question is directed to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance. He will know that recent labour force figures show he now has one more economic accomplishment, namely, that more Canadians are staying out of work longer. The January figures showed that the number of Canadians unemployed for 14 weeks or longer was 18 per cent higher than last year. Most of those Canadians want to work. Will the minister tell us whether he intends any new measures to help them find jobs they can go to, jobs they can work at?


No, Madam Speaker, it is not my intention to bring in new measures at this stage. Personally I have been impressed by the strength shown in the Canadian employment picture in the last year. The rate of unemployment is moderating and is less than it was last month. In those circumstances I personally do not intend to bring in any further measures in addition to those announced by the Minister of Employment and Immigration and the Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce, which are directed toward skill training and adjustment programs. They seem to be the most appropriate response in present circumstances.


Madam Speaker, the minister has now set another record. He has shown that not only is he prepared to have more Canadians out of work longer, but he is prepared to stand up in the House and boast about it. It is an absolutely unacceptable position for a Minister of Finance of this country.


Hear, hear!


Madam Speaker, perhaps I should address my supplementary to the Minister of State for Finance as it is of particular concern to the province of Quebec where the permanent unemployment problem is much more serious than anywhere else in Canada. The figures published by Statistics Canada show that the rate of permanent unemployment in Quebec is more than double the rate in the rest of Canada. Is there a program that the minister would recommend to the government to assist Quebecers in finding the jobs that they want today?


Madam Speaker, the Leader of the Opposition should know that this government has always taken into account the region-

February 19, 1981
Oral Questions
al implications of its policies. Whether in the fight against unemployment or in the area of industrialization, the government has always considered the particular concerns and problems of the regions, and this same policy was followed in the last budget. The problem mentioned by the Leader of the Opposition is of constant concern to the government.


Madam Speaker, some preoccupation! It means that the rate of permanent unemployment in the province of Quebec and in much of Atlantic Canada is double the rate in the rest of the country. I suppose we can ask that the rest of the country be spared that kind of special preoccupation.
Let me return to the Minister of Finance. He will know that one other impact of his government ignoring the Canadian economic situation has been a dramatic growth in the rate of the hidden unemployed in the country. Statistics Canada indicated that the rate of hidden unemployed-Canadians who are simply giving up hope and stopping their search for jobs- rose 25 per cent last year. We have a situation where one agency of government has identified those people. I ask the Minister of Finance whether his department intends to do anything to help those people who are out of work and have lost hope to such a degree that they are not even looking for work.


Madam Speaker, I think the right hon. member's rhetoric must be put in perspective and in context. The context is that the employment situation in Canada over the year 1980 was such that we registered a drop in the level of unemployment in January, 1981. The number of persons unemployed in January, 1981, was less than it was in mid-1978. The over-all strength of the Canadian economy in producing jobs, despite the serious level of unemployment, was quite considerable in comparison with other countries, especially the United States. We are concerned about unemployment. That is why we have launched this special adjustment program, which I described earlier. We are not in a position like that of the Leader of the Opposition, who advocates new measures of spending one day, and restraint and a battle against inflation the next. We do not have the luxury of inconsistency which the official opposition portrays every day.


Madam Speaker, my supplementary question is for the Minister of Finance. I want to assure the minister that we are not engaged here in rhetoric. We are engaged in the potential tragedy and human suffering behind those figures. There are 1,300,000 people, given the real rate and hidden rate of unemployment, in Canada today, some 1,300,000 potential human tragedies.
In light of the lowering of real wages, the increase in the cost of unemployment insurance premiums, the lowering of the rate of unemployment insurance benefits as a result of continuing double-digit inflation, and the increase in the hidden rate of unemployment and the real rate of unemployment, I ask the minister, one year after he has assumed his responsibilities, will he now discharge the commitment he made when he was in opposition that the government should not be waging its monetary and fiscal policies on the backs of the unemployed and the poor?


Hear, hear!


Madam Speaker, I am again surprised at the inconsistency in the attitude of the official opposition. Earlier in the week the member for St. John's West was advocating a strong stand against inflation and a strong stand against spending, as has been the case throughout the last several months. Today the hon. member takes a different course, like his leader, and suggests new expensive programs. I would ask him how he can balance these two contrary objectives, one day advocating spending more in the way of stimulation of the economy, and the next day advocating a reduction in the deficit by spending less. I do not have the luxury, as Minister of Finance, of speaking out of both sides of my mouth.


Madam Speaker, I would suggest to the minister that if he wants guidance he should take a look at President Reagan's economic package which he presented last night.


Oh, oh!


Hear, hear!


The President of the United States made a commitment that there would be no decrease in social payments in the United States.


Oh, oh!


What we are talking about in Canada is a change in priorities. Will the Minister of Finance rearrange his priorities so that he can discharge the commitment he made a year ago to the poor, the low-income earners and the unemployed of this country? We have seen during that year a total erosion of the $35 income supplement, which is all he has in his bag.


Hear, hear!


Madam Speaker, the statement made by the hon. member about the guaranteed income supplement is totally false. The guaranteed income supplement has not been eroded.


It sure has.
February 19, 1981


It is fully indexed. It increases and maintains its real value in line with changes in the cost of living . That the value has eroded is one of the biggest falsehoods which has been put forward in the House of Commons. The guaranteed income supplement maintains its real value.
I want to tell the hon. member that I do not intend to take guidance, as he has suggested, from the message given last night by the President of the United States in terms of the reduction of expenditures. Shall I take guidance and reduce spending on the arts and humanities? Shall I take guidance and reduce expenditures on welfare, as the hon. member suggests? Shall I take guidance and reduce expenditures on meal aid subsidies to schools by a billion and a half? Shall I take guidance and cut medicare by a very substantial amount? That is the kind of guidance I am not taking from the Leader of the Opposition, from the hon. member for St. John's West, or from the President of the United States.


Tell us about the meals you have cut out, Jean.


My question, Madam Speaker, is for the Deputy Prime Minister. I would have thought one Regan was bad enough for this government without their having to choose to follow another one.
My question has to do with the announcement yesterday by the Solicitor General that the Prime Minister has appointed ministers to be responsible for constituencies throughout Canada including those not chosen by the people of Canada. When was the Solicitor General appointed as minister responsible for the riding of Broadview-Greenwood, and other ridings which he did not mention? What is the exact nature of his duties, and could the Deputy Prime Minister tell us what ridings he is responsible for now?


First of all, Madam Speaker, I want to assure the hon. member that the Government of Canada does not believe that any minister has been given responsibility for representing, in this House of Commons, any riding other than the riding for which he has been elected. That is the view of the Government of Canada.
What I would like to tell the hon. member is that ministers for various regions of the country have special responsibilities within the cabinet for representing the interests of those regions.


Handing out cheques is a tough job.


For example, for almost 17 years now I have had a special responsibility within the cabinet for representing the interests of my region, namely, the province of
Oral Questions
Nova Scotia. That is not to say that I usurp the rights of any other Member of Parliament from that province. The fact of the matter is that other Members of Parliament are not present at the cabinet table to represent the interests of their particular regions, and that is precisely the role that ministers in the Government of Canada perform as regional ministers. I believe it is an essential role, time honoured, and ought to be appreciated by members of this House.


Madam Speaker, what unmitigated nonsense from the Minister of Finance. It is totally contrary to the patronizing drivel we heard yesterday from the Solicitor General, and the Minister of Finance knows perfectly well that you do not have to be represented at the cabinet table in order to hand out cheques and to indicate to the constituents of a particular riding that a minister has been named responsible for that riding. Those are precisely the words the Solicitor General used in his letter to my constituents-


Order, please. I would urge the hon. member to put his question.


Those are precisely the words that he used yesterday in the House. The Deputy Prime Minister did not answer the first question. What are the duties as described by the Solicitor General yesterday, who is carrying out those duties, and will you table a list of ministers who are responsible for particular constituencies, as indicated yesterday by the Solicitor General?


Madam Speaker, I did answer the question.


You did not answer it.


Slippery shoes!


As I understand it, it was a follow-up to the question of privilege which was raised yesterday to the effect that in some way ministers of the Crown were supplanting the proper role of Members of Parliament in the House of Commons.


Exactly.


Now you are getting the point.


That is the question that I am answering, and the hon. member has agreed that it is the question. I am telling him that it is not the policy of the Government of Canada to usurp in any way the proper role of Members of Parliament in representing their constituencies in the House of Commons. Not at all. I would be the first to object to that procedure, but I think it is essential, in our system of government, that ministers be given responsibilities for representing in a special way the interests of their regions in the cabinet and around the cabinet table. That has been the tradition, and it is simply that tradition that is reflected in my answer and the responsibilities which the Solicitor General is carrying.

February 19, 1981
Oral Questions


Madam Speaker, the Minister of Finance would try to pretend that he is the piano player in the brothel who does not know what is going on upstairs.


Oh, oh!


I can assure you, Madam Speaker, that it is not a very convincing part.
Let the Minister of Finance answer this simple question: what is the nature of the duties assigned to the Solicitor General of Canada with respect to my riding and with respect to other constituencies? Will he table the list of those ministers who are carrying out these functions, and will he please tell us what in God's name they are?


Madam Speaker, the hon. member knows about a lot of things but one thing he does not know anything about is cabinet government, and maybe he never will.


Oink, oink, oink!


Order, please. Order! Will the House come back to order? This only shortens the question period. The hon. Minister of Finance.


The hon. member has asked for the third time what the responsibilities of regional ministers are. I would be glad to go over the ground for the hon. member. The first point I want to make is that it is the special responsibility of regional ministers-


Table the list.


-to represent the interests of regions within the cabinet.


Table the list.


In my region-


Table the list.


Hon. members are saying "table the list." I will come to that, but I want to answer the question first.


You had three tries.


In my particular region, and I have discharged this particular responsibility long enough to know what it represents-


Too long.


In my region it means around the cabinet table representing the interests of all the region, the 11 constituencies in that region. When it was a question of providing in the constituency of Annapolis Valley-Hants a very substantial program of assistance to Michelin, it was not possible for the hon. member for Annapolis Valley-Hants to come to the cabinet table and argue that case-


What about Firestone.


-but it was possible for me, as the regional minister, to do that.


Hear, hear!


That is the main function of regional ministers. The hon. member has made a great to do about tabling the list. When the Prime Minister comes back I will be happy to recommend to him that he make the list available. I am sure that that list will be on the Table and will confound the hon. member and begin the process of educating him in the process of cabinet government.


Hear, hear!


Madam Speaker, I know you will agree with me when I say it is very, very distressing for this House to watch a marriage break up before our very eyes.


Hear, hear!


My question is for the Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources, and it relates to a letter which came from the president of Maison Placements, an investment firm in Montreal. This letter refers to what the writer calls clear signs of a major leak in connection with the Petrofina acquisition, resulting in illegal profits to many people. It goes on to observe that the price of Petrofina shares was around $60 when the first rumour came into the market place, compared to the price bid of $120. 1 should point out that a chart which I have shows that Petrofina skyrocketed during this period whereas BP Canada, which is the other candidate for acquisition, was flat, and probably is a little bit lower in price now than the shares were at the time of the first rumours regarding Petrofina.
I have raised this point in the House on a number of occasions. The clear reason fo' this is that these leaks have driven up the price and have caused the Canadian taxpayers and consumers to pay more money for Petrofina. My question is this. Upon receipt of this letter what action has the minister taken? Specifically, has he referred the letter to the Toronto Stock Exchange which is investigating this situation, and has he discussed the matter with the president of Petro-Canada? This question is similar to the one I asked the minister about a week ago, to which I got no answer.


Madam Speaker, the hon. member referred to a possible marriage break-up. I hope he will not be attending a divorce next Friday night.


Oh, oh!


Your wit is as good as your energy policy.
February 19, 1981


1 could give a very short answer to the question, Madam Speaker. We have never received the letter in question. I suspect the citizen in question called the press before he managed to get the letter over to me.


He sent it through the Post Office.


I can tell the House what I have told it before. This gentleman appears to be an investment broker, but if he knew his business he would already have gone to the Ontario Securities Commission or the Quebec Securities Commission if he has any information, and asked for an investigation or inquiry.


You don't care.


If he has any evidence at all, that is the way things are done. My hon. friend was in the investment business so surely he knows that this is the way things are done. The securities commissions of the provincial governments are there to investigate exactly that kind of charge.


What are you hiding, Marc?


As to the general price, the settlement, the hon. member knows, and I would refer to the fact that partners in his former firm have already indicated this publicly, that the price paid by Petro-Canada was a fair price in the circumstances for both parties. I invite my friend to phone his former partners and get advice from them rather than from some individual who appears to be more eager to get letters to the press than to my department.


Madam Speaker, I might point out that there are other responsible people in the investment business who have been quoted as saying this Canadianization policy, carried out in this way, is going to cost Canadian taxpayers an arm and a leg. I was in the investment business, Madam Speaker, and I was involved in a number of transactions similar to this. When there were any leaks I, or other people involved in the transaction, took fast action to find out where those leaks occurred and took fast action to make sure that they did not occur again. The minister has shown no concern, no sense of urgency-


Order, please. The hon. member used to be much shorter with his questions.


Oh, oh!


I think he is following the bad example of some other members on both sides in this House. The hon. member on a short question.


Madam Speaker, this is an important issue. I am trying to make an impact on the minister who is clearly showing no sense of urgency at all.
In view of the fact that the amount of the premium in dollars is $700 million over the price in September, could the
Oral Questions
minister tell the House why he has taken no action to find out where those leaks occurred?


Madam Speaker, first I would remind the hon. member that the premium paid at the time of the transaction was lower proportionately than premiums paid at the time of transactions in takeovers all over North America the last year. The difference was about 37 per cent versus 56 per cent or 57 per cent as an average in the private sector. My friend should be aware of that.
As far as the other point raised by my hon. friend is concerned, I did invite him or anyone else who has particular evidence, or any evidence at all, about anything improper having taken place, to bring it to my attention, and I will transfer it with great pleasure to the Ontario or Quebec Securities Commission-


You will transfer it?


-or to go directly to those commissions. Under the law, as my hon. friend knows, having been in the investment business, the securities commissions are the agencies which investigate these matters.


You are responsible for Petro-Canada.


That is what the law provides for in this country.


What is your responsibility?


These are the institutions to provide the investigations. In the meantime, I do not think it is responsible to level innuendo as my hon. friend has done, without any evidence.


Madam Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources. Mr. Robert Blair, who just had a favourable resolution introduced in the House by one of his Liberal colleagues here, was in bad company yesterday; he spoke to the Toronto Liberal Association. Speaking about his company, Nova Corp., he said that it will have to cut back oil production in Saskatchewan, that the company is now losing about $1 on each barrel of Saskatchewan oil because of the minister's new energy program, that it does not have enough money to cover production costs-also as a result of the program-for 50,000 barrels of crude a day. He said that unless the provinces and the federal government have an agreement by April or May, he will have to follow his accountant's advice and shut down his operation. This will cost Canada about $400 million a year in additional subsidies for crude oil.
I say to the minister that this is not the Alberta government, so 1 do not want to hear silly excuses that they will not

February 19, 1981
Oral Questions
negotiate. Has the minister entered into negotiations with the government of Saskatchewan-his friends in the NDP government of Saskatchewan-to resolve this pricing situation in Saskatchewan, particularly the question which may affect heavy oil production in Saskatchewan? If the minister has, at what stage are these discussions, and when does the minister expect a solution so as to save Canada this tremendous additional cost?
Hon. Marc Lalonde (Minister of Energy, Mines and
Resources): Madam Speaker, I would remind the hon. member that Husky Oil, a subsidiary of Nova Corp., has indicated that it is increasing its exploration budget this year rather than decreasing it, contrary to other announcements by some companies.


How about its production?


Second, I have had discussions with my colleague in the government of Saskatchewan, something I have been unable to do with my colleague in Alberta, and there have been discussions at the officials level. We both recognize that the combination of the taxation provided under the National Energy Program and the very high royalties provided for under the Saskatchewan legislation make it difficult with regard to certain wells for some companies. Those negotiations are taking place. I have had a very fruitful meeting with my colleague from Saskatchewan, and I am looking forward to further discussions in the next while.


Madam Speaker, my supplementary question is for the Minister of Finance. The hon. member for Annapolis Valley-Hants was the one who put "Hants in the minister's pants" to get action at the Michelin rubber factory.


Try again.


I would not attempt to put ants in the pants of the minister of energy.


Oh, oh!


When the little red rump quietens down, I will go on with my question.
On October 28 the minister announced his new energy policy. Mr. Blair, a well-known Canadian nationalist, said yesterday:
-he is disappointed that the federal government has not yet substantially modified various provisions in the program that cut industry revenues and thus discourage exploration and development.
In view of that statement by a Canadian nationalist owning a Canadian-owned major oil company, is the minister now going to insist that this program be changed to meet these objections so that Canada can have some kind of an economic recovery in the 1980s? Will he overrule his colleague and bring in changes to the program?


Order, please.


Madam Speaker, if I may be permitted to comment on the hon. member's preamble about Annapolis Valley-Hants and the member for that district, I congratulate him for understanding the process, but I wish he would take the hon. member for Broadview-Greenwood behind the curtain and explain it to him so that understanding would develop on all sides of the House.


That is your job.


He is in bed with you. You are not in bed with me.


Oh, oh!


Madam Speaker, on the question which the hon. member raised, we have already undertaken significant changes in the program in response to representations from the industry. I mention the change in the treatment of exploration expenses and a change in the treatment of incentive payments with respect to the income or cash flow of corporations. As the Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources has said, we are prepared to consider changes as representations and changes are made. That is the situation we face at the moment.


Madam Speaker, my question is for the Minister of National Health and Welfare.
Could the Minister tell the House whether the provincial governments have all responded to the invitation to take part in the national conference on private pension funds? If not, can she tell us which provinces have not responded or have refused to take part?


Madam Speaker, I am happy to report that no province has refused to take part in this conference. However, following the letter sent by the Right Hon. Prime Minister to the provincial premiers just before Christmas, the four Atlantic provinces, the province of Saskatchewan, the Northwest Territories and the Yukon have already appointed a minister responsible for pension reform, and I of course regret that the other provinces, especially Quebec and Ontario, have not yet found the time to do so. We hope that all those invited will be able to take part in this conference at the end of March in view of its importance for the pension funds of all Canadians.
February 19, 1981


Madam Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Labour. Would the minister be prepared to confirm that the B.C. Telephone Company has absolutely refused to sign an agreement worked out by his mediator, accepted by both sides, until such time as it receives a second increase from the CRTC? If this is correct, can the minister tell this House precisely what action he intends to take in order to ensure that the people of Canada are not blackmailed by these multinational corporations?


Madam Speaker, the factual situation is not exactly as outlined by the hon. member, but it is nearly as bizarre.
Our very able mediator, Bill Kelly, sent a telegram to me yesterday in which he indicated that after his mediation he had brought about an offer by the company, the substance of which was accepted in totality by the union. In effect, all differences between the parties have been resolved on clauses within the agreement.
However, the company's proposal contains the following preamble:
This proposal is made on the basis that it will not be implemented until a sufficient rate increase is approved by the CRTC to cover the additional costs.
1 only want to say that, as Mr. Kelly reported in his document, such increases are totally outside the field of labour relations or of my department, or of the government, or of the parties. I am not aware, in my experience in industrial relations, of any occasion in history in which any of the many utilities that are subject to regulation in this country ever before sought to put such a provision in a collective agreement. I think it is unfortunate. I can only say, in relation to what action can be taken at this moment, that Mr. Kelly has mediated to the point and that there is agreement on the clauses of the agreement and the terms, except for this preamble. One can hope that upon reflection the company will recognize the impossibility of any union accepting the particular clause they propose, though I have had a lengthy discussion on the telephone with Mr. MacFarlane-


Order.


-and I was unable to notice much progress in that regard.


I know the minister has a lot of important things to say, but perhaps he will say them more concisely.


Madam Speaker, it is precisely what I said, that we are being blackmailed. What I would like to ask the minister, since his words do not seem to be strong enough is this: will the minister recommend to his cabinet colleagues that
Oral Questions
they use their statutory power to roll back the CRTC's increase recommendation until such time as this company is prepared to sign a contract with its workers?


Madam Speaker, the hon. member probably is aware that there can only be a review of the CRTC increase recently given to the B.C. Telephone Company if an appeal is registered within whatever is the appropriate time period. As I understand the situation, that appeal process is open to various citizens and organizations. However, I think that the productive course of action is for the company to accept the fact that, since they have been able to agree on terms, they should sign the agreement and then make whatever application they consider is appropriate, which is perfectly their right.
I had started to say that I spoke to the president on the telephone, and I was unable to make much progress with Mr. MacFarlane in that regard.


Madam Speaker, my question is to the Secretary of State for External Affairs. The minister will know that yesterday press reports out of Washington confirmed the U.S. congressional support for increased military aid to the government of El Salvador, and also said that U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman, Senator Percy, "will not rule out the use of U.S. troops in El Salvador."
Bearing in mind Canada's support for the United Nations declaration regarding non-intervention in El Salvador, and the representations the minister has had from the people of El Salvador, will the minister tell the House about his conversation with General Haig in Washington that gave him "reason to pause" in pursuing Canada's foreign policy toward El Salvador? Is the government now supporting a military solution to that tragic conflict?


Madam Speaker, there has been no change with respect to Canada's policy concerning El Salvador. We have continued to protest, and protested again recently to the government there about what we understand are violations of human rights. With respect to the supply of offensive arms, our position has been that that should not be done, either by our country or by any other country, in a situation where there is internal discord. What I said was that I did not believe, however, that we should be leading a public crusade against the attitudes of the American administration which believes that it is acting in its own interest, and on the basis of information which it possesses and which it is beginning to share with its allies.


Madam Speaker, I notice on this issue a change from the usual expression of opinion on human rights

issues. My question, in supplementary form, to the minister is: in the light of our commitment in the declaration signed on May 27, 1980, between Canada and Mexico regarding nonintervention, has the minister been in touch with the Mexican government regarding joint pressure on the American government?


Madam Speaker, no, I have not at this point discussed that with the Mexican government. I hope to have a chance of talking with the Mexican foreign minister soon, but I must say that I am not contemplating, at this point, any joint approach to the U.S. on that subject.


Madam Speaker, I wish to direct my question to the minister responsible for regional economic expansion. In his absence, and in light of what the Deputy Prime Minister said today, I do not know whether to direct it to him in his responsibility for paying out all the money to Nova Scotia, or whether I should direct it to the acting minister for DREE, the Minister of Public Works. Since it concerns him, I suppose I should direct it to the Minister of Public Works.
In view of the recent news release by the Department of Regional Economic Expansion that buyers for institutions of the government in the Atlantic region are purchasing an average of 9 per cent of their goods from sources outside the region, although comparable products made in the Atlantic region are available at the same or lower prices, I wish to ask the minister what steps will be taken to encourage the various sectors of the federal government, which have substantial buying quotas, to make their purchases for their needs in Atlantic Canada from manufacturers in the region?


Madam Speaker, I would be quite happy to take the representation of the hon. member under advisement and to bring it to the attention not only of the Minister of Regional Economic Expansion but, as well, other ministries that similarly may have some interaction in that particular region.


Madam Speaker, I have one brief supplementary question because the minister himself may well be in a position to do something about this. Since the DREE survey discovered that 10 per cent of government purchases were from regional manufacturers while another 10 per cent could have been bought from Atlantic producers at a lower price than that paid, I would like to ask him why are locally produced products, priced below competition from outside the region, not being purchased, and as a suggestion for him and the rest of the government, will the government consider in future making these purchases from the lowest of public tenders, or have public tenders gone out of style under this government?


Madam Speaker, again, without having notice of the question that is asked, I have indicated that I will bring the question to the attention of the minister. I assume that he is referring to the Ministry of Regional Economic Expansion in terms of purchasing. Without knowing the prices involved and the like, I feel I would have to bring it to the attention of the minister.


Madam Speaker, my question is to the President of the Treasury Board. As chair person of the Standing Committee on Fisheries and Forestry, I am aware that some members of the committee are anxious to commence hearings on east and west coast fisheries matters. Can the President of the Treasury Board tell the House when the main estimates will be tabled in the House so the committee may get a reference to commence hearings?


Madam Speaker, I am pleased to advise the House I will table the main estimates on February 25. That is next Wednesday.


I see no other course but to extend the question period today for about ten minutes in order to make up the time lost on laughing and jeering. Much of it was in good fun, and I do not object to that from time to time, but there must be a reasonable number of questioners every day in the question period.


Madam Speaker, I would like to address a question to the Minister of Transport, who plays a piano in his office and may not know what is going on in his department. I would like to know if the minister can confirm that one Robert Titley, an executive with Voyageur Bus Company, has either been offered the position or appointed to the position of director of railway passenger service development in the Ministry of Transport.


Madam Speaker, indeed I am aware of it. The gentleman in question passed a Public Service Commission examination. There were seven or eight other candidates, and he won. That is the way the cookie crumbled.
I am surprised that the hon. member resents the fact that a person who has been occupied in trucking can then also be
February 19, 1981

interested in railways. I am particularly surprised because my hon. friend is known as a multi-modalist. He has been a defender of a multi-modal station in Regina, which seems to incorporate the best of multi-modal attitudes.


Madam Speaker, it would be great if Voya-geur Bus Lines were in favour of co-operating with VIA Rail, but what the minister is doing now is like putting a coyote in charge of the chicken coop. This is a company which has roadblocked every move with respect to railway fares and with respect to co-operation with VIA Rail regarding schedules.


Guess who owns it?


It is owned by Power Corporation of Canada.


Oh, oh!


One Paul Martin lobbied Members of Parliament because he thought VIA Rail fares were too low.


Order. Will the hon. member ask his question?


I want to ask the minister if he can find somebody, somewhere in Canada or anywhere else in the world, who knows something about high speed intercity rail passenger traffic to appoint to this important position and do something about strengthening and enlarging that branch of his department, since air transport has three pages of listings in the government directory and rail transport has one inch?


Madam Speaker, a moment ago the Minister of Finance was trying to teach cabinet government to one of the hon. member's colleagues. I will now have to teach the hon. member something about public administration in Canada. I heard about this appointment this afternoon when I was coming here. This is done under law by the Public Service Commission of Canada. I am in no way influencing the choice which has been made.


Madam Speaker, in the absence of the Right Hon. Prime Minister I would like to direct my question to the minister responsible for the environment of Canada.
Since the hon. member for Niagara Falls has thrown up his hands in his fight against the further pollution of the Niagara River and has indicated that it is now up to an exchange between high level authorities in the United States and Canadian governments to protect the quality of that river, will the minister indicate to this House what action the Prime Minister has taken or his government has taken to follow
Oral Questions
through on the Prime Minister's promise made a year ago that he would urge U.S. authorities to stop SCA from further dumping in the Niagara River?


Madam Speaker, I take issue with the first part of the hon. member's statement. There has been no member of this House and, indeed, no person I know who has been more active and vigorous in promoting the cause of the clean-up of the Niagara River than the hon. member for Niagara Falls.


Hear, hear!


His record in that regard deserves the approbation of hon. members of this House.
We have consistently urged on American authorities that permits not be given for the SCA discharge until there has been a significant decrease in the present polluting activities with respect to the Niagara River. We are particularly concerned about the Niagara Falls, New York, sewage treatment plant. Our position on that has not been altered, and we have on a variety of occasions as vigorously as possible expressed our views to the American authorities.


Madam Speaker, that response is such that I have to wonder why there was a negative response to my motion under Standing Order 43.
In view of the fact that the International Joint Commission has recommended a halt to the further discharge of chemical wastes into the Niagara River, do the minister and his government not now take the position that the International Joint Commission should be supported in its position and its recommendations followed?


Madam Speaker, we have done so in the past, we do so now, and I am sure we will continue to do so in the future.


Madam Speaker, my question is directed to the Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources. Now that the new administration in the United States is settling in, and in view of the fact that 80 per cent of the pipe which will be manufactured for the pipeline in Canada will be manufactured in the Welland constituency, I wonder if the Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources could tell us if he has had any contact with the American secretary in charge of energy or the pipeline with regard to the Alaska Highway gas pipeline project, and would he share whatever information he has with this House?


Madam Speaker, I believe I have already

February 19, 1981
Oral Questions
informed the House of my conversation with Secretary Edwards on this issue and about the reaction of the Reagan administration, which is extremely supportive of the Alaska gas pipeline. I am advised that today my colleague in the other place, Senator Olson, as the minister responsible for the Northern Pipeline Agency, has released an exchange of correspondence between himself and Secretary Edwards in which Secretary Edwards reaffirms the very, very firm commitment of the Reagan administration to the completion of the Alaska gas pipeline and assures us that the American government is fully behind this great project.


Madam Speaker, my question is directed to the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development. During a visit last fall to the Bigstone Band in Wabasca the minister promised financial assistance to Chief William Beaver of the Bigstone Band so that that band could continue with its sawmill operation and so it could continue with its band programs. This has not been forthcoming. Could the minister inform the House whether this will be forthcoming and whether he will be providing this assistance?


Madam Speaker, as the hon. member indicated, I did convey to my department my concern about assistance to this particular band because of the very real need. I thought progress was being made in terms of offering assistance to this particular band. If that is not the case, I will check and let the hon. member know.


Madam Speaker, these promises were made five months ago, and at the present time the Bigstone Band is facing cancellation of its timber quota. Logs will be left in the bush to rot over the summer. All the employees of the sawmill have been laid off. The band office has been shut down and all employees laid off. Is this just an empty promise? Can the minister do something about it, or is this just a continuing public relations campaign being waged through statements like this by all ministers of the Crown in northeastern Alberta?


No, Madam Speaker. As the hon. member knows, there is real concern with respect to the dire financial circumstances of Chief William Beaver and his band. I believe the House is aware of the unfortunate situation with respect to personnel involved in the bookkeeping and auditing arrangements. This has been brought to the att
