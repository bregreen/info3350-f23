Madam Speaker, I rise under the provisions of Standing Order 43 on a matter of urgent and pressing necessity. Today Canadians from coast to coast are joining together to welcome to our nation the President of the United States of America, the Honourable Ronald Reagan. Accordingly, parliamentarians should put aside their complaints and grievances, subdue rancour, and truly represent the friendly spirit of the Canadian people toward our southern neighbour. Therefore I move, seconded by the hon. member for Burlington (Mr. Kempling):
That this House recognize the interdependence and common interests of Canada and the United States of America by extending our warmest welcome to the President and by expressing our hope that good faith and mutual trust will govern our future deliberations.


Hear, hear!


Is there unanimous consent for this motion?


Agreed.


The House has heard the terms of the motion. Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the said motion?


Agreed.


Motion agreed to.
Madam Speaker, I rise with some indication from both the government side and our side that this motion would receive the consent of the House. I hope that the members of the New Democratic Party, who I know espouse the doctrine of freedom of speech, can see their way to do likewise.
My motion is in regard to the incident occurring today in front of the Centre Block of the Parliament Buildings during addresses made by the President of the United States and the Prime Minister of Canada. I move, seconded by the hon. member for Timmins-Chapleau (Mr. Chenier):
That the House reaffirm its belief in the rights of all Canadians to demonstrate peacefully and freely in promotion of their personal views but at the same time this House deplores the attempt by certain minorities to drown out the right of the President and the Prime Minister to exercise freedom of speech in the same manner as cherished by such minority groups and, finally, the House assures the President of the United States that this is in no way typical of Canadian hospitality and it commends the Prime Minister of Canada for his impromptu remarks at the conclusion of the ceremony admonishing those who performed a regrettable act.


Hear, hear!


Is there unanimous consent for this motion?


Agreed.


The House has heard the terms of the motion. Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the said motion?


Agreed.


Motion agreed to.
Madam Speaker, bank profits for the first quarter of the banking year are dramatically higher. In the case of the Royal Bank they are up 76 per cent and in the case of the Bank of Commerce they are up 69 per cent, while industrial corporation profits show a decline of 7.2 per cent, as reported by Statistics Canada on Friday. Clearly, bank profits are up because of the government's high interest policy. I therefore move, seconded by the hon. member for Portage-Marquette (Mr. Mayer):
That the Minister of Finance, on motions, explain to this House why he is maintaining his high interest policy to the benefit of the big banks and to the detriment of productivity in industry and to the detriment of the ordinary people of Canada, and why the banking business is now more profitable than the oil industry or, indeed, any other business in Canada, and if the Minister of Consumer and Corporate Affairs will be publishing a seven-volume report detailing how the banks, in league with the government's high interest policy, are so profitable.


Is there unanimous consent for this motion?

March 10, !98!


Agreed.


No.


Madam Speaker, as I, too, rise in the same light as our tribute to freedom of speech and democratic institutions, I am certain that members to my right will support the following motion.
Considering that on September 11, 1973, the late president of Chile, Salvador Allende, gave his life in La Moneda Palace defending the democratically elected government of Chile against the military coup headed by Augusto Pinochet, and considering that since that day the Pinochet regime has systematically suppressed and brutalized the Chilean people, I move, seconded by the hon. member for Saskatoon East (Mr. Ogle):
That this House requests that the government instruct its ambassador in Santiago not to attend the ceremony to take place March 11, 1981, which will illegally instal the dictator Augusto Pinochet in La Moneda Presidential Palace and condemn the attempt by the Chilean junta to institutionalize its reign of terror in an imposed constitution.


Is there unanimous consent for this motion?

Madam Speaker, I rise under Standing Order 43 on a matter of urgent and pressing necessity. In the past few days, we, as well as the Canadian people, have witnessed a deterioration and a glaring violation of the respect which should characterize this House. I refer to the racist, hollow and entirely unacceptable comments made in violation of our most basic rights and freedoms last week by members of the official opposition, the member for Winnipeg-Assiniboine (Mr. McKenzie) and the member for Simcoe-South (Mr. Stewart) and others, who deplored among other things the fact that Lord Durham's report had never been enforced so as to make English the only compulsory language in Canada.
I move, seconded by the hon. member for Temiscamingue (Mr. Tousignant):
That following such comments, the Leader of the Official Opposition show himself in his true colours and make it clear to all Canadians whether he stands with the 50 per cent of moderates within his party, those who act according to their conscience, or with the racist extremists. Does he agree or not with such comments? If not, let him prove it by expelling-

Madam Speaker, I rise under the provisions of Standing Order 43. Whereas over 2,000 university students in Poland are risking their liberty and lives to demonstrate against excessive state involvement in their lives, including mandatory courses in Marxism, I move, seconded by the hon. member for Bow River (Mr. Taylor):
That this House exchange the authors of the National Energy Program for the over 2,000 students who want an opportunity to build better lives, and further, in order to sweeten the deal, that we throw in all the NDP members who constantly call for more state involvement here in Canada.


Is there unanimous consent for this motion?

Madam Speaker, I rise under the provisions of Standing Order 43. Given the fact that in implementing its energy policy with reference to Canada lands this administration has come under attack by companies based in other countries which have charged our Government of Canada with not honouring the sanctity of the contract, I move, seconded by the hon. member for Edmonton East (Mr. Yurko):
That the Government of Canada clarify its position with the international community in terms of honouring contracts and agreements.


Is there unanimous consent for this motion?


Agreed.

Madam Speaker, I too rise under the provisions of Standing Order 43 to move a motion which I am sure my Conservative friends will support. Whereas last week the Canadian ambassador to the United States said that Canada still offers foreign energy firms a warmer welcome than they can find almost anywhere else in the world and whereas on Friday the United States state department sent a strongly-worded communique to the Department of External Affairs protesting the very mild national energy policy in Canada, I move, seconded by the hon. member for Selkirk-Interlake (Mr. Sargeant):
That this House instruct the Prime Minister to inform the President of the United States that the United States should recognize Canada's right to own and control its own resources, especially in the oil and gas field, which assets are owned by foreigners to the tune of 84 per cent and that it is not in Canada's best interest to take part in a continental energy policy.


Is there unanimous consent for this motion?


Agreed.


No.


Madam Speaker, I rise on a matter of urgent and pressing necessity and move, seconded by the hon. member for Sudbury (Mr. Frith):
That this House condemn the three Alberta daily newspapers which are stirring up regional dissension in order to sell more copies, the profits from which are flowing back to the national monolithic press chains now in Canada.


Is there unanimous consent for this motion?


Agreed.


No.


Madam Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Finance, who was supposed to be here, but who probably could not get through the security. I will address my question to the Acting Prime Minister. A year ago today the government instituted the
Oral Questions
floating Bank of Canada rate. At that time the Minister of Finance said that the government would consider special assistance for home owners if interest rates soared under the new floating rate approach. At that time the Bank of Canada rate was 14 per cent, and today it is 17.16 per cent. The prime bank rate was 15 per cent at that time, and today it is 18.25 per cent, or 3.25 per cent more. It has certainly soared. The Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce said that he was pleased with the new approach to interest rate policy.
My question to the Acting Prime Minister is this: is the government still pleased with this floating interest rate policy? Also, in view of the fact that rates have soared, will the government now institute special assistance to home owners to help them with these soaring interest rates as was promised by the Minister of Finance on behalf of the government last year?
[ Translation]


Madam Speaker, the hon. member knows full well that, as indicated in the budget, the Minister of Finance is far from being satisfied with current interest rates in Canada. However, the hon. member should also bear in mind that those interest rates reflect the inflationary pressure on the over-all economy. He knows very well that interest rates are one factor in the fight against inflation and that if all economic agents join forces to combat inflation and we manage to reduce the inflationary pressure we will end up with lower interest rates and everybody will be more satisfied.


I wish to direct a supplementary question to the same Acting Prime Minister, Madam Speaker.


Hear, hear!


His answer made just as much sense as the Minister of Finance would have made. Would the minister answer the question about assistance to home owners in view of the promise made by his minister last year? Would he also answer this? The prime bank rate in Canada is still 18.25 per cent although the U.S. bank rate has come down from December when it was 21.5 per cent to 18.5 per cent, a drop of 3 per cent, but the Bank of Canada rate and the prime bank rate have not dropped. In these circumstances will the minister now direct the Bank of Canada to reduce the Bank of Canada rate correspondingly, or will the government continue its policy of propping up the Bank of Canada rate and Canadian interest rates? Would he give us a clear answer to that?
[ Translation]


With respect to the first point, Madam Speaker, I thought the hon. member was aware of the connection between the fight against inflation and the interest rates so that if on the one hand the government launches a massive attack against inflation and on the other hand makes grants to help not only home owners who need them but also small businessmen, agricultural producers and all groups in society

March 10, 1981
Oral Questions
who suffer from this high interest situation, we would thus be cancelling what we want to achieve as a first step.
Second, the hon. member knows very well that the rates set every Thursday during the auction sale are flexible and reflect the expectations and apprehensions of the market with respect to the inflationary push so that those rates mirror Canada's current situation. The hon. member may recall that not so very long ago our interest rates were way below those which our neighbours to the south had to cope with. Now, of course, the situation has changed and the rates continue to reflect the over-all condition of Canada's current economy.


Madam Speaker, the minister is a master of befuddlement, "on the one hand and on the other hand". It was a straight question. May I point out to the minister that the Bank of England dropped its bank rate today from 14 per cent to 12 per cent? We are asking the minister to drop the Canadian rate now from 17.16 per cent because the U.S. rate has fallen 3 per cent in the last few weeks while our rate has not fallen at all.
The minister is aware that bank profits are at a tremendous peak. There has been a 76 per cent increase in profits for the Royal Bank of Canada. The reason given is the spread between the prime bank rate and the rates paid by banks on borrowed money. The United Kingdom has just introduced a special tax to provide an $880 million payment from the windfall profits of the English banks made because of high interest rates. I ask the minister whether he is contemplating such a similar tax, or any action at all, in connection with the difference in the spread? Is the minister contemplating a decrease in the Bank of Canada rate? These are the questions. Never mind giving answers "on the one hand or the other", and telling us you are fighting against inflation. We want to know-


Order, please.


Madam Speaker, I am quite amazed not at the questions but at the comments of the hon. member. The one he has just made clearly indicated that he is not interested in understanding the general situation. He is interested in statements, in other words his rhetoric and his style, and he does not want to understand anything and try to have them explained to him. 1 regret that the hon. member who is a former finance minister now refuses to understand the current situation and would want the government to answer him in the same rhetorical terms he uses to put his questions.


Madam Speaker, in the absence of most of the inner cabinet perhaps I could put my question to an outer cabinet minister, the President of the Treasury Board.


Oh, oh!


How far out can you get?


As we all know, the President of the Treasury Board absolutely flubbed the introduction in this House of the main estimates of his department. Could the minister indicate why he has chosen to turn down the request to meet with the miscellaneous estimates committee last night, today and Thursday, bearing in mind that when the request was made the minister was free on all three occasions?


Explain that one.


Madam Speaker, I thought the hon. member was rising in his place to apologize for his curious behaviour of two weeks ago.


Hear, hear!


With respect to appearing before the miscellaneous estimates committee, I will be delighted to do so. Last night was not possible. I was advised that the committee meetings were cancelled today and that the Tory party was having a caucus on Thursday morning. I have since spoken to the chairman of the committee who advises me that to the best of his knowledge the committee will be meeting on Thursday morning. I will be delighted to attend because I have been waiting a year to receive an intelligent question from the hon. member for York-Peel.


Hear, hear!


Oh, oh!


Madam Speaker, may 1 put my supplementary question to the same minister? It touches on Supplementary Estimates C which were introduced in this House, on which the guillotine will fall, as we know, within two weeks. Would the minister tell us whether he is aware that he has included 30 $1 items in those Supplementary Estimates C, totalling $868 million of expenditures or guarantees to be incurred on behalf of the Government of Canada? If he is aware that there is over $868 million included in the $30 worth of items, would he explain to this House why he thinks that is fair disclosure to the House and to
March 10, 1981

the people of Canada? Is that not really a shocking concealment of the expenditures of the government?


Oh, oh!


Hear, hear!


Madam Speaker, the hon. member for York-Peel is always shocked by everything he does not understand.


Oh, oh!


Hear, hear!


I will verify the hon. member's arithmetic, as I normally do, and I will be happy to respond to any specific questions on Thursday morning before the miscellaneous estimates committee.


It is with great pleasure and gratitude for the honour he does to us that I draw the attention of the House to the presence in our gallery of a former Governor General and former Speaker of this House, His Excellency Mr. Roland Michener, and Mrs. Michener.


Hear, hear!


I also draw attention to the presence in our gallery of the Premier of Nova Scotia, Mr. John Buchanan.


Hear, hear!


Madam Speaker, in the absence of the Secretary of State for External Affairs I will direct my question to his parliamentary secretary. It is further to the situation in El Salvador, which was debated seriously and well in this House of Commons yesterday. I feel that the members of this House and the people of Canada would give strong support to the positions that we proposed with regard to stopping military assistance to that country. I wish to ask the parliamentary secretary how the Government of Canada is going to influence the international community in a positive way to bring about a political solution in El Salvador, as other countries such as Mexico and West Germany are proposing?
Oral Questions


Madam Speaker, the hon. member is right in saying that we had a serious debate on the problems in El Salvador, but I would like to point out that it is certainly not by attacking our neighbours and best allies, the United States, that we will make a useful contribution toward improving the present situation in El Salvador. In this regard, Madam Speaker, I believe that the motion introduced yesterday was unfortunately unbalanced and rather incomplete, which prevented us from agreeing to it. The Secretary of State for External Affairs has made it clear on several occasions to representatives of the El Salvador government, both to the Salvadorian ambassador in Ottawa and through our own ambassador in Costa Rica, that we greatly deplore the violation of human rights in that country. Unfortunately, as long as arms reach that country from other sources, we cannot attack the American government exclusively on this matter.


Madam Speaker, I was not attacking the American government. I was asking for positive responses from the Canadian government with regard to establishing a peaceful zone. I understand from this morning's news that the government has cut back on its aid to El Salvador. In the recent past there were similar circumstances, in Zimbabwe for example, where the people were rising up to control their own future. Will the parliamentary secretary explain how Canada will approach its very serious role in North-South relations as it relates to aid to that country?


Madam Speaker, the hon. member says that he is not attacking the American government, but that was essentially the purpose of the resolution or motion introduced in the House yesterday. As for any cut back in Canadian assistance to El Salvador, Madam Speaker

I would like to have a bit of silence, Madam Speaker. If the hon. members do not want an answer, I shall simply sit down and shut up. As for our reduced assistance, I must point out that we are critized when we maintain our level of assistance in similar situations. Canada will continue to play its role through the usual channels, and these are not problems which can be solved through spectacular debates in a public forum.


Madam Speaker, I am afraid the parliamentary secretary has the wrong page in his briefing notes.


Oh, oh!

March 10, 1981

Oral Questions


During the debate yesterday it was brought up many times that we Canadians did not in a sense have any role or any expertise in that area. As a last question to the parliamentary secretary, will he now please tell the House how the government plans to have us acquire that expertise and that role in that area, just as we would if we had a sick neighbour down the street we did not know but would have to help?
[ Translation)


Madam Speaker, in view of the wording of yesterday's motion, I had concluded that the New Democratic Party believed that it had this expertise and that it was well aware of the facts. As for the briefing notes, I must point out to the hon. member that not having any, I could not therefore have the wrong page.


Madam Speaker, I have a question for the Minister of Communications. In spite of his commitment several weeks ago to end the CBC journalists' strike, in spite of a major shift in the position of the union and in spite of several courageous efforts at mediation made by the Department of Labour, the CBC management's position has not changed and the newspersons are still on strike. Could the minister advise the House of the steps he intends to take to settle this strike, especially when one considers that the government is seeking our approval for a 12.4 per cent increase in the estimates of the CBC, while the CBC management will not budge an inch from its 8 per cent raise offer to its journalists, and when one considers also that the CBC management will refuse to make a final offer until the union agrees to recommend it to its membership without first looking into it.


Madam Speaker, the hon. member knows well the nature of the system under which the CBC operates. From time immemorial, the parties on both sides of the House have reaffirmed the basic concept that CBC should be free from all government interference and able to conduct its broadcasting business independently from the government as far as content and labour relations are concerned.
On the other hand, the hon. member is ill informed. Before asking such questions in the House, he should know that the CBC management's position has changed over the weeks and months. Although an agreement has not been reached, the fact remains that the money items include a lump sum offer of
$2,300 to each of the 180 newspersons and that the special mediator appointed by the Minister of Labour has explored all possible avenues of settlement. For the time being, the union has turned down the salary offers, but the CBC management is willing to return to the bargaining table and to continue negotiating in the hope that a settlement will soon be reached.


Madam Speaker, I should like to put a supplementary to the Secretary of State and Minister of Communications.
The minister knows full well that this strike, the longest in the history of Radio-Canada, is reducing coverage of the constitutional debate in Quebec, that the rest of Canada is less aware of the fact that Quebec is opposed to the constitutional proposals and that, should the strike continue, it will prevent practically any coverage at all of the provincial elections in a large part of the province.
Madam Speaker, will the government assume its responsibility for giving that service, because as Quebecers and francophones across the country become increasingly aware of Radio-Canada's persistent resistance to setting this strike they are led to believe that the government wants the strike to continue, and that, for political reasons?


Madam Speaker, this is the first time I have ever heard a spokesman of the opposition ask the government to intervene directly in the daily operations of Radio-Canada. If that is the new position of the Progressive Conservative Party, Madam Speaker, that is, to put an end to the principle which anglophones in this country have always known as the- [English]
-"arm's length principle". I am astounded that hon. members of the opposition would ask this government to cast aside the arm's length principle which has always been one of the basic principles of this government in dealing with culturalism.


Hear, hear!


Order, please. I do not know what has happened to the House today, but I wish it were a little bit quieter. I recognize the Right Hon. Leader of the Opposition.


Madam Speaker, there are very many of us who have long memories about the arm's length relationship with the CBC; we remember the words of the Prime Minister who was going to put on the lid and shut the doors of the CBC, and we remember the words of the minister, now the Minister of Consumer and Corporate Affairs-


Question.
March 10, 1981


And my question to the Minister of Communications concerns-


The strike.


The strike, yes, but-

My question to the minister has to do with how long the government expects this strike to continue, and particularly, since there are rumours of an imminent provincial election in Quebec, whether it is in the plans of the government to take action to ensure that there will be coverage in the province of Quebec of all sides in an election campaign, or will it consign the people of Quebec to the same news blackout during an election campaign to which its actions consigned the people of Quebec during the constitutional debate?
[ Translation]


Madam Speaker, as I said last week in reply to a question from another member from Calgary on cablevision coverage, I think it is this side of the House which suffers from lack of coverage because if the Canadian people, especially francophones in Quebec, could actually see how weak the arguments but forward by the Hon. Leader of the Opposition and his party are, it would be much to our advantage, and in that sense we are most anxious to see the strike come to an end.


I have a supplementary, Madam Speaker. For the sake of national unity I will point out to the minister the distinction between Calgary and Edmonton; there is a slight difference. I think that the basic question here is whether the people of Quebec will be able to benefit from the services of the CBC French network during such crucial time as a provincial election. We had a situation where the residents of the province of Quebec were denied the right to watch on television the debates of the constitutional committee as well as events with great significance for their future. So the question now is whether the federal government which is responsible for the CBC French network is prepared to go along with another delay which could deny Quebecers the right to watch the provincial election debates on the CBC French network.


Madam Speaker, as I said earlier in answer to the Leader of the Opposition, we are continuing negotiations with the union to which the CBC French network is not party. The Minister of Labour has appointed a mediator whom the Leader of the Opposition knows very well. We have been trying for a long time to settle that strike. The latest salary
Oral Questions
offer from the CBC even included a lump-sum payment of $2,300.
I would say to the Leader of the Opposition that his remark about the difference between Calgary and Edmonton could be checked with the hon. member who put the question to me last week, and I would tell him that that member does indeed represent a Calgary and not an Edmonton riding.


Madam Speaker, my supplementary question is directed to the Minister of Labour. I would like to ask whether the Government of Canada has a deadline for the settlement of this strike and, if so, what is that deadline?


Madam Speaker, the right hon. gentleman is fully aware that under the powers of the Department of Labour it is not possible to have a deadline, that the role of the department is to provide expert mediation services to the parties to help bring about an agreement, and therefore if he is asking whether we are considering legislating an end to the strike and removing the right of collective bargaining, we are not considering that. I can assure him of that.
However, I do assure him through you, Madam Speaker, that the negotiations are continuing, that our mediator is very much involved, and it is true that the union membership turned down an offer by the CBC last Friday. I believe it will be necessary for both parties to move further than they have for an agreement to be achieved. I think it is appropriate in particular for the CBC to improve its wage offer, but there also may be some further movement required on the part of the union. I believe that with some give and take an agreement is possible, and I hope that it can come very soon.


March 10, 1981
Ora! Questions


Madam Speaker, I would like to tell the hon. member that a few months ago we commissioned a major study on the question of domestic workers by Miss Mary Eberts, a well-known lawyer in this area and Toronto. That report is now complete and it is my intention to release it in a matter of two or three weeks, after I have had a chance to review it.
My colleague, the Minister of State for Multiculturalism, has organized a conference dealing with the problems of immigrant women, and we will be discussing that issue and those problems during that conference. We will have an opportunity to present the paper and at that time we will be able to look at the very serious problems affecting domestic workers in this country.


Madam Speaker, the minister will be aware that many of these domestics have unemployment insurance and Canada Pension Plan premiums deducted from their wages, that very few of them can collect unemployment insurance, and that when they leave the country very few know that they are entitled to a refund of their CPP contributions. Is that report going to deal with that question and will the minister make clear to these people when they come to this country what their rights are with regard to unemployment insurance benefits and the Canada Pension Plan?


Madam Speaker, I would be glad to tell the hon. member that that specific issue is dealt with in the paper. There are a number of solutions proposed in the report, and once we have had an opportunity to make it public and get some response, then we will take corrective action.


Madam Speaker, my question is for the Minister of State for Science and Technology.
In view of the fact the Japanese have become the world leaders in trademark applications, with the latest figures for 1977 indicating that Japanese applications account for about 25 per cent of the world total, will the Minister of Science and Technology create the same climate of incentive in Canada for research and development to compete with Japan and the world in trademark applications, in the hope of increasing our competitive position in world trade?


Madam Speaker, as the hon. gentleman I hope is aware, we have
recently indicated to the public and Parliament the kind of five-year track of spending we believe is required to increase our research capacity in the science and technology fields.
We also have currently under study a variety of other approaches, tax measures and other means of trying to encourage the kind of research and development we wish to see take place in the private sector, and I will certainly be interested in the ideas which he has put forward stemming from other countries which we might usefully adapt to our own situation.


Madam Speaker, my question is to the minister responsible for the status of women and relates to the arm's length approach the government always takes.
The minister announced on Friday the appointment of six members to the Canadian Advisory Council on the Status of Women, to fill vacancies which came about in January when several members resigned to protest his political interference. He also elevated to president a loyal supporter in Doris Anderson's place. After all the public discussion on the appointment process, why did the minister not heed the concerns of women's groups and consult more widely, or does he find it too tiresome to do this?


Madam Speaker, we have obviously heeded the concerns because we appointed extremely well qualified people, and if the hon. member would care to look at the qualifications of those who were appointed he will find that not only do they represent a good cross-section of points of view of women in this country-


Of the Liberal Party.


But also represent very well the strong feminist activities in the regions from which they come.


Madam Speaker, the question did not relate to the qualifications but to the process, and neither the national action committee nor provincial advisory councils were consulted.
Having received many representations calling for an independent, external review of the advisory council to restore its sagging credibility, news reports now suggest that the cabinet has decided there be no immediate review of the council because it might be politically embarrassing. Will the minister tell the House when the government will end this elitist, patronage-oriented process? Will there be a truly independent review of the council?


Madam Speaker, we might come to an end of some things as soon as the hon. members opposite end the kind of inflammatory language they use with respect to that
March 10, 1981

council, which does not help any situation. And I would indicate to the hon. member that, just as his own research is obviously unreliable, we have some unreliable leaks in the government service as well, because the fact of the matter is we are discussing with women's groups, including the advisory council, the question of a review. It was raised with the council yesterday and I will await their discussion and recommendations, which I hope to have any day now.


Madam Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Transport in his capacity of answering for the Canadian Wheat Board. Farmers in Canada are becoming sick and tired over the continuing promises for compensation on the limited grain embargo imposed on the Soviet Union, in which Canada participated. Has the Canadian Wheat Board yet indicated to the government the level of compensation that should be paid, and if so, has the matter been brought up before cabinet?


Madam Speaker, this question comes under the authority of the Minister of Agriculture and I pass it on to him.


Madam Speaker, a study of the losses that grain producers may have suffered has been submitted to cabinet for decision. We are honouring the former government's commitment.


Madam Speaker, the minister has indicated the study has been submitted to cabinet. Given the fact the government is not stalling or fudging or hedging on this particular issue, can he indicate to the House when farmers in Canada will likely know the amount of compensation the government is going to pay?


Madam Speaker, my question is directed to the Minister of Employment and Immigration. Having been associated closely in the past with the general amnesty program entitled "Operation mon Pays- Operation Canada my Country", and knowing that in Quebec we are on the eve of a provincial election, can the minister inform the House if there is any truth in the rumour of a general amnesty for illegal immigrants in Quebec, following a
Oral Questions
request of the Quebec minister of immigration who is now encouraging illegal immigrants to visit Quebec immigration offices for a special screening test?


Madam Speaker, I have not yet received any official communication from the minister of immigration for the province of Quebec. We contacted his office and we were told that he did not in any way issue a call for general amnesty. He was simply prepared to take illegal immigrants on a case by case basis to see if there were any grounds for humanitarian consideration. However, I will be meeting with the minister of immigration from that province tomorrow. But I can tell the House that we certainly have no intention at this time of any general amnesty; because it really does not solve the problem of illegal immigrants in the country.


Madam Speaker, my question is directed to the Minister of Agriculture to whom I sent notice. Under the Animal Disease and Protection Act, all animal products from other countries must be destroyed or returned to the country of origin in order to avoid bringing disease into Canada. A similar act exists for plants. Unfortunately, due to a dispute between Agriculture Canada and the Air Traffic Association of Canada as to who will pay the cost, incinerators have not been built to take care of wastes from commercial international flights at prairie airports. Could the minister tell the House if his department has an agreement with the Air Traffic Association of Canada regarding the building of these incinerators? If so, what is the nature of the agreement, and when will incinerators be built?


Madam Speaker, I have been informed by my officials that progress has been made. The airlines are responding to our complaints. At the moment we consider the progress satisfactory. CP Air is building one, and the negotiations at Calgary, Edmonton and Winnipeg are proceeding as we hoped they would. They seem to have accepted the idea that they are responsible for this. It is food that has not been consumed on airlines travelling to some country other than the United States of America.


Madam Speaker, I have a supplementary question. Another area in which there are financial considerations or a lack of personnel for the protection of consumers and farmers from disease organisms from outside the country is that of veterinary inspection. There seems to be a number of available vacancies. Without getting into the problems which exist now between the department and existing veterinary inspectors, is the problem of providing an adequate service a simple one of not enough money, or is there

March 10, 1981
Oral Questions
a shortage of adequately trained personnel to fill the positions which are now available?


Madam Speaker, in answer to the hon. member, I believe it is a combination of both. There is a shortage of moneys and there is also a shortage of properly trained personnel.


Madam Speaker, in the absence of the Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources and the Postmaster General, I should like to direct my question to the Acting Prime Minister. I assure him that this party and people across the country are very interested in energy self-sufficiency and are aware of the government program for emergency energy rationing.
Is the minister aware of the directive which has gone to local post offices across Canada asking them to prepare for the distribution of coupons for gasoline rationing?


Madam Speaker, I am not aware of that but 1 will inquire. I would find it quite normal, if we are to be prepared for any eventuality, for the Department of Energy, Mines and Resources to be ready for such a possibility.


Madam Speaker, my supplementary question is directed to the Acting Prime Minister. I should like to assure him that this is not just a casual preparation for any eventuality; this is a specific directive which has told people in post offices across Canada that their workers, as of April 1, 1981, will be asked to work 14 hours a day to distribute these coupons to people for gasoline rationing.
Will the minister inform the House of the total effect of this? What does the government really have in mind? Does this mean that we have an emergency energy situation and that the National Energy Program has indeed been a failure?


That we know.


Madam Speaker, it is the characteristic of an emergency not to be expected. But I will find out further, and I am sure my hon. friend will have his answer in the coming days.


Madam Speaker, 1 should like to direct my question to the Minister of Agriculture. It is supplementary to the one posed by the hon. member for Lisgar with respect to the compensation to which western grain farmers are entitled as a result of the embargo on the U.S.S.R.
The minister has been putting off the decision and the announcement. It was originally planned to be given by August 1, 1980, at the end of the crop year. It was put off, and at the beginning of December the minister said that it would be a few days. Will the minister make a commitment now that any compensation determined by cabinet will include an interest rate from the end of the last crop year equal to the interest rates that western farmers carry on their supplies and costs? Will he make a commitment that they will be entitled to receive interest on this long overdue compensation?


Madam Speaker, the hon. member knows as well as I that it not only includes western farmers, it includes commercial grain farmers in any part of Canada. It is an important factor also in the central part of Canada because, for instance, the province of Ontario produces more commercial grain than the province of Manitoba. So, it affects them similarly.
I cannot say what the decision will be. The submission has been made, but the hon. member is so wrong. The crop year only ended on August 1. How in the world could we have all the figures calculated by that time? It took longer than we thought. We thought we would have them ready for November
1.	We did not have them by late November or December 1. We did not have them until some time in December, and I believe they were considered in January. They were considered at that time interdepartmentally, and not too many days or weeks ago they were submitted to cabinet. They are being considered in a very concentrated and determined fashion at the present time.
I wish I could tell the hon. member that interest rates and all that will be considered. But he is fully aware that in the last year one and a quarter crops have been delivered. So, a tremendous amount of grain has been moved. When we were talking about making the payments to them, many farmers said that they did not want them before January 1, that they wanted them after that because they did not want to pay too much income tax. So, the shortage of money is not as the hon. member said.


Madam Speaker, in the speech from the throne at the start of this session the Prime Minister and the government gave Members of Parliament from western Canada a special mandate to speak on behalf of western grain farmers. That is what my colleagues and I on this side of the House are trying to do. But, all we get from the government is double talk, double track, and double cross.
Would the minister make a commitment that a statement will be made and that payment will be forthcoming to western Canadian farmers before the end of this month? It is a simple question. I would like an answer.
March 10, 1981


Madam Speaker, if everything goes as smoothly as we hope, well, that could be possible.


Madam Speaker, my question is directed to the Minister of Agriculture. Is my understanding of what he just said to the hon. member for Saskatoon West correct, that the government is considering paying compensation for the embargo to grain farmers for grain produced and consumed in Canada?


Madam Speaker, I never made any mention of grain being consumed in Canada or being sold outside Canada. The hon. member will have to wait and see our submission and how we figured it out. It will all be made public once a government decision is made.


Madam Speaker, my supplementary question is directed to the same minister. It concerns his responsibility for the herd maintenance program in western Canada. I understand the minister still carries some responsibility for that program. Madam Speaker, we have been told that snow was a criteria for rainfall. The appeal board has advised the minister that snow should be removed. I am asking the minister how the cattle producers of western Canada can feed their cattle on Liberal promises and snowballs, after March 31 when funding has been cut off?


Madam Speaker, the hon. member knows how fat an animal can get on snowballs and Liberal promises. But he also knows how fat they can get on Conservative wind, as far as that goes.


Order!


On Wednesday last the hon. member for Broadview-Greenwood (Mr. Rae) raised a question of privilege with respect to the matter of distribution of grants in constituencies represented by members on the government side and by members of the opposition. I might point out that this is a political, not a procedural, problem. Several members of the House have acknowledged that it was not a question of
Order Paper Questions
privilege, as I think the hon. member for Broadview-Greenwood did. In the course of his remarks the hon. member asked me to comment on the wisdom of a practice which appears to discriminate against opposition members.
I was also asked by members to comment on a ruling of Mr. Speaker Jerome, dated December 10, 1979, which was referred to on several occasions. In this regard I want to say that I agree with the principle of that ruling, which stated in part that:
-the support of public funds, where applied to parliamentary activities ought... to apply across the floor of Parliament.
I have no hesitation in stating that I have no quarrel with this part of the ruling, and I will apply it when it has relevancy.
In his ruling Mr. Speaker Jerome offered certain comments which were also mentioned in the House last Wednesday. Whatever reasons Mr. Speaker Jerome had for commenting, not ruling, on the wisdom of a certain practice, the comments are separate and apart from matters of order or privilege.
As I said in my observations of last Wednesday:
I would hesitate to comment on situations which are not clearly put to me for a ruling to be made.
In other words, I shall do my duties as required under the rules to determine questions of order or privilege. But I would be going beyond my duties of applying procedural rules if I were to comment on my predecessor's remarks or on matters not procedural. That, of course, I cannot do.


Madam Speaker, I am pleased to table 4,000 petitions from constituents and others supporting the proposed resolution to patriate the Constitution with an amending formula and a charter of rights and freedoms, including in that charter of rights the concept of multiculturalism.


Hear, hear!

Madam Speaker, the following questions will be answered today: Nos. 1,645, 1,970, 2,030 and 2,054.

March 10, 1981
Order Paper Questions


1.	Did the Minister of National Health and Welfare announce on October 21, 1980, that a Canada-France Agreement had been signed on social security and that a similar agreement was signed with Italy in January, 1979, and, if so, are negotiations taking place with other countries at the present time in a similar vein and, if so, in each case (a) what is the name of the country (b) on what date did negotiations commence (c) how are they progressing and what is the anticipated date of conclusion?
2.	Are the United States and Great Britain involved in such negotiations and, if not, for what reason?


1. The Minister of National Health and Welfare announced on October 21, 1980, that an administrative arrangement had been signed, defining the provisions for the administration of the Canada-France Agreement on social security which had been signed on February 9, 1979. This agreement will enter into force on March 1, 1981. A similar agreement with Italy which had been signed on November 17, 1977, entered into force on January 1, 1979. An agreement is to be signed with Portugal in December, 1980, and it is expected to enter into force in early 1981. Negotiations in a similar vein, or preliminary contacts with a view to such negotiations, are currently under way with other countries as follows:
(a)	Greece.
(b)	A preliminary information meeting was held in Ottawa from October 14 to 16, 1980.
(c)	Consensus was reached on the general parameters of an eventual agreement and on a timetable for preparing a draft of such an instrument. The signing of an agreement is anticipated for the spring of 1981.
(a)	Belgium.
(b)	No formal negotiations have yet taken place, although a preliminary information meeting was held in Ottawa in July, 1978.
(c)	Further discussions are required to develop mutually acceptable provisions of an agreement.
2.	Technical discussions were held by U.S. and Canadian officials in Ottawa in October, 1979, and in Washington in July, 1980. The conclusion and signature of an agreement and the necessary administrative arrangement will hopefully take place early in 1981. A first meeting concerning a possible agreement took place between British and Canadian officials in London in July, 1977. Since then there have been numerous contacts and communications at the official, ministerial and prime ministerial levels in an attempt to persuade the British side to commence formal negotiations. On October 22, 1980, in London, the Right Hon. Patrick Jenkin, Secretary of State for Social Services in the government of the United Kingdom, indicated categorically to the Minister of National Health and Welfare that, for financial reasons, there was no possibility at all for an agreement and no scope for keeping the door open for negotiations on an agreement in the future.
