Madam Speaker, Randy Ludlow has been declared to be a danger to the public by two psychiatrists and one clinical psychologist. He is known to have associated with Clifford Olson for four months last summer. His appearance resembles the composite published of a suspected accomplice of Olson. He was due to stand trial yesterday on another charge, but never appeared. I therefore move, seconded by the hon. member for Central Nova (Mr. MacKay):
That the Solicitor General explain to this House why the justice system allows a dangerous suspect such as this to walk the streets.


Is there unanimous consent for this motion?


Agreed.


No.


Madam Speaker, I rise under the provisions of Standing Order 43 to move, seconded by the hon. member for Halifax West (Mr. Crosby):
That this House express its profound regret at the Prime Minister's insensate comments regarding the imposition of martial law in Poland, remarks that have been widely used by the communist regime to support its position; that this House indicate to the people of Poland and to its government that Canada supports greater freedom in Poland, not less; that Canada supports the legitimate aspirations expressed by millions of Poles, through Solidarity, for greater democracy and a government responsible to Poles themselves, and that Canada opposes and will oppose in all possible ways the suppression of the Polish people by a government imposed by Moscow.


Is there unanimous consent for this motion?


Agreed.


No.


Madam Speaker, I rise under the provisions of Standing Order 43 to commend the government for wisely not obliging the Canadian beef industry to participate in the forced metric conversion program. Allowing cattlemen to continue to buy and sell under the imperial system will protect our valuable trade with the United States and eliminate weights and measures confusion in the market place. I move, seconded by the hon. member for Athabasca (Mr. Shields):
That the government reconsider its forced metric conversion program in 1982 and extend the same exemption it granted to the beef industry to the retail food sector.


Is there unanimous consent for this motion?


Agreed.


No.


Madam Speaker, I rise on a matter of urgent and pressing necessity under the provisions of Standing Order 43.
Considering that since the federal government has failed to take any action, more than 30 mayors of municipalities around Mirabel have decided to take steps in order to get a decision on the airport area problem, I move, seconded by the hon. member for Churchill (Mr. Murphy):
That the government take immediate action to deal with the problems of unused farmland, the industrial park scandal and the viability of the airport itself.

Under the provisions of Standing Order 43, this motion requires the unanimous consent of the House. Is there unanimous consent for this motion?


Agreed.


No.


Madam Speaker, thousands of workers of all ages are sad, depressed, and frustrated. They were working hard at their jobs to build a good country and a heritage for their wives and children when suddenly, right out of the blue, on November 12, 1981, the Minister of Finance blasted their dreams and hopes-no more dental care for their wives and kids, no more trips each year on passes supplied by their company, no more chances to buy shares and become an employer, no more company homes at reasonable rentals, no more of anything but taxes, taxes, taxes. I move, therefore, seconded by the hon. member for Athabasca (Mr. Shields):
That this House urges the Minister of Finance to put a ray of sunshine back into the lives of these workers by immediately packing up his ill-begotten budget and vanishing into oblivion.


Is there unanimous consent for this motion?


Agreed.


No.


Madam
Speaker, in a motion presented yesterday the New Democratic Party called for the government to outlaw extra billing in Alberta, to set up an inquiry to present proposals for the enforcement of national standards for health care, and to withdraw the finance minister's proposals for cutbacks in federal transfer payments to the provinces. I move, seconded by the hon. member for Provencher (Mr. Epp):
That this House call on the New Democratic Party to cleanse itself before telling others to clean up their act by calling on their Saskatchewan counterparts to ban extra billing in that NDP province.


Is there unanimous consent for this motion?


Agreed.


No.


Madam Speaker, I rise under the provisions of Standing Order 43. As a result of the November budget, owners and employees of automobile dealerships across the country are beginning to experience severe financial difficulty. The dealers are losing revenue because of a drop in their leasing business. Employees receiving financial assistance from their employers for the lease of a car will now be taxed on almost the entire monthly leasing charge, and dealership employees provided with a demonstrator car to advertise their product will now be taxed on the use of the vehicle. In light of the fact that this industry is already suffering the financial woes of low sales due to high interest rates I move, seconded by the hon. member for Simcoe North (Mr. Lewis):
That the Minister of Finance make an immediate change to his budget and cancel these punitive measures which are hurting the people involved.


Is there unanimous consent for this motion?


Agreed.


No.


Madam Speaker, 1 rise under the provisions of Standing Order 43. Whereas the government's policy of enticing the provinces with cushy financial deals into buying CANDU reactors for the production of electricity for export to the United States will result in unnecessary health, safety and environmental dangers for all Canadians-and perhaps some Americans as well-and whereas the government secrecy concerning financing agreements being offered to potential CANDU reactor customers abroad also shows a complete disregard for the rights of the Canadian electorate to know, I move, seconded by the hon. member for Winnipeg-Birds Hill (Mr. Blaikie):
That this House call for an independent public inquiry into the health and safety aspects of the Canadian nuclear industry, as well as to examine the squandering of billions of taxpayers' dollars by the government in a hopeless attempt to prop up this languishing loser.


Is there unanimous consent for this motion?


Agreed.


No.
January 27, 1982


Madam Speaker, the budget proposes to move federal sales tax from the manufacturing to the wholesale level. In addition to generating huge amounts of additional revenue for the government and causing retail prices to increase, this is an example of several measures in the budget that are bringing about major tax reforms without prior warning. Therefore I move, under the provisions of Standing Order 43 and seconded by the hon. member for Prince George-Bulkley Valley (Mr. McCuish):
That the government refer this topic to committee for proper consideration by everybody involved so that the full impact of this tax change can be fully discussed before the measure is finally implemented.


Is there unanimous consent for this motion?


Agreed.


No.


Madam Speaker, I rise under the provisions of Standing Order 43. Because it is inconsistent for the Government of Canada to enshrine cherished human and political rights in our new Constitution and to be indifferent to violations of human and national rights of the people in Poland and generally in eastern Europe, I move, seconded by the hon. member for Vegreville (Mr. Mazankowski):
That the Prime Minister condemn the military junta in Poland for violating human rights in complete disregard of the provisions of the Helsinki agreement and for the suppression of the Solidarity trade union.


Is there unanimous consent for this motion?


Agreed.


No.


Madam Speaker, I rise under the provisions of Standing Order 43 on a matter of urgent and pressing necessity for small businesses in Canada. Small businesses are experiencing a growing problem of collecting accounts receivable, and one of the worst offenders
Oral Questions
when it comes to slow payment is the federal government. Payment for goods and services sold to the federal government is often not received for three, four or more months and, to add insult to injury, no interest is paid on accounts outstanding more than 30 days. Therefore I move, seconded by the hon. member for Burnaby (Mr. Robinson):
That this House direct the Minister of Supply and Services to remedy this burden the federal government is placing on Canada's small businesses.


Is there unanimous consent for this motion?


Agreed.


No.


Madam Speaker, I have a question for the Minister of Finance concerning the tax measures which will affect senior Canadians who are receiving retirement income. The minister will remove the $1,000 exemption for those pensioners who receive other income and contribute to registered retirement savings plans. Many of these pensioners have retired from the armed forces, the police, and the public service, with very modest pensions.
Where is the justice in taxing senior citizens who are trying to provide for their old age? Will he explain how taxing a Canadian who must supplement his or her pension income and postpone real retirement can result in more equity in the tax system? Why should Parliament punish senior Canadians who want to maintain their independence? Do we really need that kind of revenue?


Madam Speaker, the hon. member has made a very stirring appeal to consider that particular case of the deduction that is available for retired persons. The main objective of that change in the budget proposal was to eliminate that deduction for persons who are not retired. I will certainly listen to the hon. member's representations very carefully when we have those matters in the committee of the Whole.


Madam Speaker, we are pleased with the conciliatory tone of the Minister of Finance, but I wish he would promise here and now to make a

January 27, 1982
Oral Questions
change in that particular provision. Senior Canadians are the ones who are affected.


Hear, hear!


I want to tell the minister also that it was not retired business executives who came to our special committee with this concern, it was the Consumers Association of Canada. It is the little man who can be hurt by this provision. That is what we are concerned with, Madam Speaker.
We want to know about the minister's statistics. The minister has said in this House that 12 million Canadians will pay less tax but seven million Canadians will pay tax on health plans. Whose statistics are right? The statistics of the Canadian Labour Congress, or the statistics of the minister? I would like the minister to confirm the statistics and tell us who will pay more taxes.


Madam Speaker, all the facts are stated in the tables that were presented with the budget. They show that almost 12 million Canadians, as a result of the budget, will pay less tax in 1982 than in 1981, that about 3.5 million Canadians will pay about the same level of taxes, and that about 800,000 Canadian taxpayers will pay more taxes. Those are the statistics that are in the tax tables. They are public knowledge. If the Canadian Labour Congress and other bodies can contest these statistics, then I will examine their contestations. However, I believe the statistics to be accurate and to reflect the actual situation.


They have already contested them.


Madam Speaker, it is very difficult for any Member of Parliament to argue with the minister's statistics, but Canadians will know in ensuing tax years whether more Canadians or fewer Canadians will be paying tax, and that will be the test.
However, I want to know in a more general way how the minister can explain some items in the budget. In the minister's 1980 budget speech he said that Canada had one of the best tax systems in the world. He said that in 1980.


Hear, hear!


Last year, 1981, the minister said that many Canadians find the tax system unfair, and he agrees with them. Who are those Canadians? Are they the backbenchers in the Liberal Party who thought the new tax measures were needed?


Order, please. I am afraid that we did not get the question. I would like the hon. member to repeat his question, but only his question.


Madam Speaker, it is difficult to phrase a question when we have contradictory remarks in two budgets. I will simply ask the minister which remark is true?


Madam Speaker, there is nothing contradictory, in my mind.


Oh, oh!


It seems to me that even the best can be improved. I stated that our system was among the best. It is among the best, but it still can be improved, and that is what I was attempting to do.


Madam Speaker, my question is directed to the Minister of Finance. One of the areas in which the minister's November budget created unnecessary financial hardship for Canadians is the area dealing with life insurance. Could the minister tell the House why the approximately nine million low and middle-income policyholders who have life insurance are now being harassed by the government? Why are they being discouraged from protecting their families and their own security in retirement? Why are they being punished by being asked to pay tax on their policies before they receive any cash benefit whatever?


Madam Speaker, I am pleased the hon. member raised that question because it gives me an opportunity to straighten the record. The fact is that no existing policyholder in any part of Canada is affected by the budget provisions of November 12. Let me repeat that: no existing policyholders. That is the fact. I hope that the message gets out. 1 can assure the hon. member that no existing policyholder is harassed, punished, affected, or impacted by taxes because all of them, all of the existing policyholders, are not touched whatever. I would like that to be put out.


Read the budget.


Madam Speaker, I am sure the minister is aware his predecessor brought in something similar and withdrew it. I hope the minister will decide to withdraw entirely any tax on the life insurance industry, RRSPs and the like, because no one-as a life insurance agent I can emphasize this-in their right minds would be investing in any form of life insurance because of high interest rates available in other forms.
Will the minister withdraw anything and everything he has agreed to or considered doing regarding life insurance, annuities, or anything else?
January 27, 1982


Well, Madam Speaker, as long as the hon. member is now satisfied there is no impact whatsoever on existing policyholders, then I believe we have made some progress.
The hon. member has referred to the general provisions affecting the life insurance industry, and I believe his question deserves a careful answer. The first point is that I suggested on December 18 that, subject to appropriate parliamentary arrangements, I was prepared to send that question to a standing committee for examination. Second, I have undertaken through my officials to have, and indeed already have had consultations, with the insurance industry, and it is my firm objective to reach some conclusions with them which hopefully would meet both their difficulties and my concerns as Minister of Finance.
These meetings have taken place. Just this week I had a discussion with one of the leaders of the industry whose view was that it might be possible to reach a mutually satisfactory conclusion. So there are two avenues open to the hon. member to reflect upon, instead of asking me to withdraw the important changes which are to the benefit of the people of Canada.


We are seeing another retreat from Moscow.


Madam Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Finance. Today in the United States, analysts, in response to President Reagan's State of the Union Address last night, are now saying interest rates there are going to go up. 1 ask the minister, should this occur, will he on behalf of the Government of Canada assure the people of Canada that we will not pursue that disastrous economic policy here?


Madam Speaker, first of all the hon. member's question is hypothetical, and I assure him it is not my intention to adopt any disastrous economic policies.


Other than the one you have.


We have expressed more than once our concern about the interest rate policy being pursued in the United States. On the occasion of the Summit in Ottawa last summer all the representatives drew similar concerns to the attention of the United States. They have been restated since that time, but it seems to me that we cannot predict what will happen in the United States except 1 did, on Monday in Toronto, express my concern about that possibility in certain circumstances in the United States.
Oral Questions


Madam Speaker, I did not ask the minister to predict what would happen in the United States; I just asked him to make for once an unequivocal assertion that if interest rates go up in the United States, as many analysts now say they will as a result of President Reagan's address last night, the Government of Canada will not follow that policy. It is pretty straightforward. Surely even the minister could respond to that.
However, I would like to move to a different aspect of the government's policy.

The minister was busy, in his speech yesterday, boasting about the number of Canadians who were going to get a tax cut. He did not tell us which Canadians, or how much. Will the minister confirm that the average working Canadian will receive a tax cut of about $4 a week, but that as a result of the reduction of the tax rate in the top two income categories, a Canadian who earns $250,000 a year will get an actual reduction of $400 a week from this government? If that is so, is that his concept of Liberal justice for the people of Canada?


No, Madam Speaker. I could not confirm these false statistics used by the hon. member for Oshawa. Yesterday I laid on the record the impact of these tax changes which were made in the budget, such as tax indexing, marginal rate, and so on. The impact of that upon the average industrial wage of $22,000-


$4 a week!


-in a one-wage-earner family of four members will be a tax cut of $650-


What about energy, Allan?


-and that is not bad.


It is not bad for some, but when the government gives ten times that amount to people who are millionaires, at least some people in this country think that is a little unjust, whatever the Liberal Party may think.

My last question goes to the Prime Minister, because both the Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance have said this week that further govern-

January 27, 1982
Oral Questions
ment investment in job-creation programs at this time would not be desirable because of the impact such investment would have on the deficit. During the last election campaign the Prime Minister said that "dealing with the deficit must not be at the expense of lost jobs at a time when the economy is slowing down".
Considering that our current ratio of deficit to the gross national product is the same now as it was 12 years ago, how can he square his election promise that deficit concern would be subordinate to job creation with the government policy as expressed in the last two days in the House, which policy means, in effect, that no matter how many are unemployed in Canada, the government has no intention of creating some job investment programs which would put Canadians back to work?


Oh, you'd be surprised.


Madam Speaker, the hon. member for Oshawa is falling into his usual habit of putting up straw men and then knocking them down.


I'm talking about one!


He is ascribing positions to the government which it never took, nor did the Minister of Finance, nor did I. Concerning the priority of not solving our problems on the backs of the workers, that election promise still stands. When the hon. member quotes us as saying that we will not invest in jobs, surely he is fabricating a statement-


Except that's not what the quotation was. Listen to the quotation.


Well, I will listen to the quotation. Let us hear it again.


The hon. member for St. John's West.


Madam Speaker, let us hear the quotation.


Oh, oh!


Order. I thought the Right Hon. Prime Minister had finished his answer.


Oh, oh!


Same rules for everybody, eh?


Madam Speaker, I was in the process of indicating the moneys which we are and will be spending to create jobs. I was interrupted by the Leader of the New Democratic Party saying that, in some sense, he wanted to repeat the quotation. I was prepared to accede to him; but he does not want to take that opportunity. Let me tell him that-


Yes, 1 do!


-even in the budget, even in the white paper which we tabled at the time of the budget, even in the various speeches of the various ministers, we have indicated that
literally hundreds of millions of dollars will be spent of federal budget money in order to create jobs.


Hear, hear!


Just for western transportation alone, $1,350 million will be spent.


Oh, oh!


Double-track!


To help rehabilitate the textile, clothing and shoe industries-


Out west?


-some $350 million will be spent. To assist the pulp, paper and wood industry and rehabilitate the shipbuilding industry, some $350 million will be spent.


Oh, oh!


The figures can go on. I know that this is not the time to enumerate them. But how can the hon. member say that we are not spending any money to create jobs? This is pure invention of his twisted mind.


Hear, hear!


On a further and brief supplementary, the hon. member for Oshawa.


Madam Speaker, just in case the Prime Minister is interested in the truth, and 1 want to quote him carefully, because I am quoting him accurately, and 1 hope he will reply to the substance of the question, during the last election campaign he said that "dealing with the deficit must not be at the expense of lost jobs at a time when the economy is slowing down". The Prime Minister is nodding affirmatively. He agrees with that quotation. The other day, in debate, in the House-


Question, question!


-the Prime Minister, and then the Minister of Finance, in response to questions, indicated that the current level of deficit was too high for more spending to take place in job creation.
My question to the Prime Minister is straightforward. Since he made this comment and promise in the 1980 election, and since it is clear, as the Minister of Finance indicated in his speech in Toronto on Monday, that unemployment is following from this-


Order. The hon. member will recognize that I permitted an additional question, but I asked him to be brief, and I would like him to be just that.


I simply wanted to be clearly understood, because I want the Prime Minister to have a fair chance.
By refusing to spend more because it will increase the deficit, is the Prime Minister not reneging on a commitment that he made in the 1980 election campaign when he said that he-


Order. Order!


Order.


Madam Speaker, the quotation from the campaign was to the effect that we would not reduce the deficit or we would not solve our budgetary problems by taking away or destroying jobs. That is the effect of the quote which he just read. I repeated to the hon. member the other day that when we are budgeting for more than a $10 billion deficit, it is obvious that we are not concerned with balancing the budget as much as we are concerned with creating opportunity for investment and workers. That is why there are literally, once again, billions of dollars which are planned for spending by various departments to create jobs and stimulate economic growth.


Hear, hear!


The only recourse that the Leader of the New Democratic Party can take is to say to spend more. We can say we would spend more and put the money on paper, but right now there are hundreds of billions of unspent dollars which are going to be spent in the plans that have been laid before Parliament.


Hundreds of billions?


Let us spend that money and then, if the hon. member wants to say more, we can look at it again.


Madam Speaker, 1 would like to move from the world of fantasy land to the world of Poland.


Oh, oh!


On Monday when the Prime Minister was asked about Poland and his earlier approval of the actions of the Polish government, he said, and I quote from Monday's Hansard:
I do not believe that in advance we can or should condemn the use of troops by any of our friends-
Oral Questions
Apparently the Polish government is his friend.
The worse result in this case would have been intervention by the Soviet Union.
The Secretary of State for External Affairs has since said the Soviet Union has intervened:
-once again we must ask ourselves if there was a better scenario.
Have the Prime Minister and his government, who have now had 46 days to decide this, yet decided whether there was a better scenario than the imposition of martial law and the crushing of human rights in Poland and doing away with the rights of the trade union, Solidarity? Has that been decided, or what is the Prime Minister going to tell the world when he appears on the television program Friday or Saturday night? Was that the best scenario, or was there an even better scenario?


Madam Speaker, I have asked this question of various people, including the representative of the Polish Congress that I met the other day. 1 asked the hon. member what was his scenario. I have indicated that if the alternative was Soviet invasion, it was better to have martial law if that prevented Soviet invasion. My statement still stands. It is hypothetical. No one knows if the Soviets would have invaded or not.
One does know that the objective of all the western nations for the past two years has been to warn the Soviet Union against invasion of Poland, and against military occupation of that country. To that extent we have succeeded in preventing that worse scenario. I would like to hear the hon. member say that he would prefer to see Soviet troops occupying Poland and that that would be better for the Polish people than to have the Polish people themselves attempt to prevent that eventuality.


Madam Speaker, the Prime Minister has confirmed that what happened in Poland was the best scenario, in his opinion. In my opinion it was the worst scenario.


Hear, hear!


There was no threat of invasion by the U.S.S.R. The government's position is confused and contradictory. Apparently the Secretary of State for External Affairs has more backbone than the Prime Minister, who is positively pusillanimous in connection with Poland. My question to the Prime Minister is this. Last Monday the Prime Minister said, and I again quote from Hansard:
I will have to see in what way that martial law proceeds-
He was still not prepared to condemn martial law. Later that afternoon he met with the Canadian Polish Congress and said martial law should be relaxed. What is now the position-


What is yours?

January 27, 1982
Oral Questions


Our position is that we are totally opposed to martial law in Poland.


Hear, hear!


Order.


We think this government should represent Canadians and condemn it, and not approve it as the Prime Minister did.


Hear, hear!


The hon. member is going beyond what is permissible during a question. I cannot be any more lenient with him if he does not put his question in five words, and not more.


Oh, oh!


Will the Prime Minister now condemn the imposition of martial law and send a stern diplomatic note to the U.S.S.R. and to Poland opposing any continuation of martial law?


Hear, hear!


Let's have a five-word answer.


Madam Speaker, I think it is clear that the hon. member's position is indefensible, even from the point of view of the Polish people. I quote him. The hon. member for St. John's West said that in his opinion what was happening in Poland was the worst scenario. I do not believe that. I believe the worst scenario would have been for the Soviet army with its tanks to have marched into Poland and crushed the Polish people. That, I think, would have been worse.


Hear, hear!


Madam Speaker, my question is to the Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce. Now that the Prime Minister has announced the intended dismantling of DREE so there will no longer be a department of government concerned solely with regional economic development in Canada, will the minister tell the House whether, under his new department, the regional development incentives, formerly administered by DREE, will be available all across Canada, or will they be restricted to certain geographic areas?


Madam Speaker, what is happening is not in any way a downgrading or downplaying of the efforts and focus of the Department of Regional Economic Expansion. At the present time, and until there is appropriate legislation, the department continues to offer its help and incentive in specific areas across Canada.
I anticipate that once the activities of DREE and the Department of Industry, Trade and Commerce are integrated there will not be any lesser focus on the regional imperatives followed by DREE. If anything, there will be an enhancement of that in the interest of those areas and therefore of the entire country.


Madam Speaker, it is difficult to see how the enhancement will take place when the Prime Minister announces that there will be no more money. Is it the intention of the minister to pay development incentive grants to Canadian-owned firms only?


Madam Speaker, FIR A will follow the law in this regard to offer grants to those who will offer net economic benefits to the less advantaged regions of the country. That is the purpose, to enhance economic activity and permanent job creation in less advantaged areas of our country. This is what we are doing now and will continue doing, and our intention is to do it in a more effective and focused manner than before.


Madam Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Employment and Immigration. The minister is probably aware of a report from the Ontario government, the Manpower Commission, which forecast that Ontario faces a shortage of between 38,000 and 48,000 highly skilled workers in the next five years. Could the minister indicate what our government is prepared to do to prevent this provincial forecast and overcome this critical shortage?


Madam Speaker, the report that was prepared for the Ontario Manpower Commission simply enforces findings that were put forth by the parliamentary task force that was chaired by our colleague, the member for Notre-Dame-de-Grace-Lachine East. It simply indicates to us that it is a major priority, and in response to that task force and other representations we put forward in the first week of January a proposal for a new national training program which would shift the priority of federal support into those areas where the skill shortages are greatest. At the same time, the proposal is to

We believe very strongly that it is important to establish a national set of priorities so that we can address the problem not just in Ontario but across the country. We think that is one of the most effective ways to meet both the demand for skilled labour and also to provide a major stimulus for economic growth in Canada.


Madam Speaker, my question is directed to the Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce and Regional Economic Expansion. My question concerns an announcement made yesterday by Gulf Canada that a contract had been signed with Japanese shipyards for the construction of an icebreaker to be used in the Canadian Arctic. When the minister appeared before the Standing Committee on National Resources and Public Works, he promised to set up a program for the purpose of keeping shipbuilding projects in Canada. According to our calculations, shipping companies that have had ships built outside the country during the last two years have made Canadian workers lose 10,000 person-years. Could the minister inform us whether our figures are correct and could he also tell us why the government has as yet failed to develop an effective marine industry policy and why it has actually created more jobs in Japan than in Canada at a time when many workers in the Atlantic provinces, Quebec, Ontario and British Columbia need these jobs?


Madam Speaker, 1 shall be glad to check the figures provided by my hon. colleague as well as the facts on the contract that Gulf Canada is said to have signed with Japanese shipbuilders. I remember that not long ago, Gulf Canada announced it was giving out contracts for the construction of ships in Canadian dockyards, and the hon. member may recall that last August I announced a new government policy that would be aimed at giving Canadian industries and workers a chance to compete on an equal basis for participation in the economic and industrial spin-offs of our megaprojects. This policy is being implemented and we have almost finished work on a policy to stimulate shipbuilding in Canada by Canadian industries. I feel that we are making considerable progress and that this will continue.


Madam Speaker, the fact of the matter is that month after month, in spite of the minister's announcements and good intentions, we see ship after ship and project after project going offshore. Unfortunately, we have not seen good delivery.
Could the minister give us some indication when ships will be built in Canada, particularly in the province of Quebec where there is talk about shutting down a major shipyard because they need a project such as the one being built in Japan?


Madam Speaker, as I said just before Christmas, Gulf is giving contracts to Canadian shipyards to build ships for its offshore activity. We have recently given substantial assistance to companies such as Burrard Yarrows in British Columbia, Saint John Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company in New Brunswick, and the Halifax shipyard in Halifax, Nova Scotia, to extend their facilities to enable them to be more competitive and to build more of the vessels for offshore and world activities. We intend to continue doing that with this effort buttressed by our recently announced program to ensure on a full, fair and competitive basis, industrial spin-offs from our megaprojects to companies in Canada and Canadian workers. I think we are making a substantial effort, and we will be adding to that effort for workers and shipyards in every part of our country.


Madam Speaker, my question is for the Solicitor General. It concerns the Clifford Olson case. As I mentioned in a motion under Standing Order 43, a known suspected accomplice is loose on the streets. On October 16 the Solicitor General told my colleague from Central Nova that he was fully aware of the circumstances of the Olson case. 1 have known for some time that this suspected accomplice was about, and immediately reported it to the authorities.
I would now ask the minister, without giving any disclaimers about provincial responsibility, and knowing full well that he cannot be involved in the day to day investigation, if he is now fully informed about the Olson case and what action he has taken about the suspected accomplice.


Madam Speaker, I am not responsible for the laying of charges, particularly in offences that are under the Criminal Code to be administered under the responsibility of the Crown in the provinces. The hon. member mentioned, in his motion under Standing Order 43, that there were outstanding charges against Mr. Ludlow. I

January 27, 1982
Oral Questions
do not think the hon. member should invite me to make statements that might prejudice a fair trial.


Madam Speaker, for some time now the Solicitor General has been conducting an inquiry into the effectiveness of mandatory supervision. In light of the new cause for concern across Canada due to the Olson case about the effectiveness of the entire justice system, would the Solicitor General first of all tell us if he has completed his inquiry into the effectiveness of mandatory supervision and, in light of the concern of Canadians, will he now extend that inquiry into a full public and independent inquiry into the effectiveness of the entire justice system?


Madam Speaker, I would remind the hon. member that at the time of the offences which were the subject of the conviction of Clifford Olson, he was not under mandatory supervision. His warrant had expired and he was a free man.
As to the question of the study under way on mandatory supervision, that study has been completed and I have consulted with the interested members of the private sector, the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police, and many other groups. 1 have their views, and I am planning to go to cabinet shortly with proposals for change.
Again, I would remind the hon. member that mandatory supervision is in the law which was established by this Parliament. Neither the Solicitor General nor any other official has the authority to change those rules outside Parliament, so that whatever changes I propose and are accepted by the cabinet will have to be brought forward to this House. When they are brought forward, which I expect in the not too distant future, I hope they will receive more prompt consideration than some of the other important changes to the criminal justice system I have brought forward in legislation to this House and which have been stalled here.


Madam Speaker, my question is directed to the Solicitor General. I remind him that while Mr. Olson was out on the street he was wanted on outstanding charges in Sydney, Nova Scotia, and Williams Lake.
In view of the unusual circumstances which have arisen here, and certain questions having been raised about methods in certain areas of the administration of justice, and the perception that there were parts of the scenario about which the Solicitor General was not fully informed, has he ever been informed by his advisers whether sodium pentothal or truth-inducing drugs have been used on witnesses or accused persons?


Madam Speaker, that is a very general question. I am aware of the use and value of that drug, but I would want to have a specific question before giving a specific answer.


Madam Speaker, my question is directed to the Minister of Finance. I would like to ask him whether a study has been made as to the impact of transferring federal sales tax from the manufacturing to the wholesale level on the residents of northern and remote regions of our country. As the minister knows, most of the high cost of living in the north is associated with freight. The practice now, of course, will be that northerners will have to pay federal sales tax on one of the main components of their high cost of living, namely, freight. Has a study been undertaken into the cost to northerners of that particular provision in the budget, and can the minister report on it?


Madam Speaker, we have attempted to assess the general impact upon the economy of these changes to the sales tax. It should be made clear to hon. members that there will be a great deal of opportunity to consider these changes and to examine their impacts before the legislation will be brought in and before it will be enacted.


Madam Speaker, as the minister knows, neither in his budget nor in his statement has he dealt with the whole question of northern benefits, knowing full well that in some areas of our country the cost of the most essential items is sometimes two and three times what it is in the more populated regions of our country and that there is in place a certain tax remission or remission order. Can the minister tell us what terms of reference will be used to develop a policy which will bring about a greater degree of equity and fairness with respect to taxation on northerners generally? What he has done so far has been to place an additional burden on northerners by virtue of moving the sales tax from the manufacturing to the wholesale level, knowing full well that there are very few manufacturing facilities in the north. Most goods are shipped to wholesalers before they are distributed.


Madam Speaker, the general effect of the changes in the sales tax we are proposing will be to benefit domestic manufacturers but, as the hon. member will recall, we did extend the remission order for an additional year. As I stated in the budget papers, it is my intention to examine what alternative instruments can be put in place in order to meet the

requirements of that part of the country, such as an expenditure program rather than through the tax system.


Madam Speaker, I would like to direct my question to the Minister of Finance. It relates to the budget proposal whereby the minister will now assess to car salespersons 30 per cent of the wholesale value of the demonstrator cars they use in the course of selling cars. The minister knows that the car business has been in a slump over the last few years. We obviously want that business to increase.
In view of the fact that in December the average wholesale price of a car was $10,000, which adds $3,000 to the average taxable income of these salespersons, is the minister considering withdrawing that provision from the budget, or at least reducing that amount of taxation in order to reflect more closely the state of that industry?


No, Madam Speaker. As I have stated in reply to a number of other representations, we will have an opportunity to consider the impact of all these measures in the very long debate which has been previewed for us by the Leader of the Opposition.


Madam Speaker, my supplementary question is directed to the Minister of National Revenue. On December 18 the minister again hid behind a stock answer and said that he would deal with these tax provisions with equity and fairness. Regarding the provision of 30 per cent of taxable income for car salespersons, and specifically in view of the state of the industry at this time-for example, there are 1,200 car salespersons in Manitoba alone, so it is a large number of people who are affected-could the minister explain why, if it is dealing with fairness and equity, his own department has submitted a letter to car salesmen and the Canadian Automobile Dealers Association saying that road expenses for these people will be taxed retroactively to 1979 and 1980? These are road expenses which had been accruing and had been used to sell automobiles. Why is the minister now going back to 1979 and 1980 in order to tax these people on road expenses which previously had been allowed?


Madam Speaker, indeed it is the intention of the government
Oral Questions
to deal in fairness and equity both in the matter of law and in the matter of the application of the law. With regard to the matter about which the hon. member talks, 1 will certainly look into that because I can assure the hon. member it is not our intention to put an unfair burden on people. It is, indeed, our intention to deal with them with fairness and equity.


Madam Speaker, my question is directed to the Minister of National Health and Welfare, and it also deals with equity and fairness. In the last election campaign the Liberal Party made this promise:
The Liberals are committed to reduce poverty in Canada and to ensuring economic and social fairness for all Canadians.
How does the minister square this promise with the recent report from the National Council on Welfare which shows that some three million Canadians still live in poverty in Canada, that over half of all single pensioners over the age of 70 live in poverty, and that the distribution of income in this country has not changed since 1951? Can the minister tell us when we can expect programs to eradicate poverty in Canada?


Madam Speaker, the hon. member is addressing one of the constant problems in any society, and he wants me to solve it now when we also have a tight economic situation. I do not think his question is serious or responsible in that respect.
1 can send the hon. member recent statistics on the fight against poverty in Canada. 1 discussed this with university students in Toronto two days ago. Those statistics show that over recent years the rate of absolute real poverty in Canada has decreased from 20 per cent to 12 per cent.
Of course there is still work to be done. What we have accomplished up until now has been to index fully-at a cost of millions of dollars-the Child Tax Credit, for example, which is now almost $300 non-taxable per child. In the coming months this will go to thousands of mothers of families who are most in need at the present time.


Madam Speaker, my supplementary question is directed to the Minister of Finance. The Minister of Finance knows-or should know-that the vast majority of single women over age 65 live in poverty. The Minister of National Health and Welfare has certainly publicly stated that fact. Will the Minister of Finance agree to bring in amendments to his budget to use some of the additional revenue the government will gain from both the energy agreement and from additional taxation to increase immediately benefits for those single women over age 65 who are living in

Privilege-Mr. Deans
poverty and who rely on welfare to receive an adequate retirement income?


Madam Speaker, I would like to make one correction to the statement of the hon. member. These people do not receive welfare. They receive the Federal Guaranteed Income Supplement which is more than the amount of welfare payments, which are provincial. As soon as we can-when the economy picks up again-we will, as our first priority, increase their monthly benefits again. The description the hon. member makes is false. I should like to add that he should also address the problem of those from age 60 to 65. If the provinces wanted to-if Ontario decides tomorrow to bring the welfare payment to a decent level, which is not the case to date, we would immediately pay back 50 per cent of that. But it cannot be a federal initiative; it must come from the province.


I have notice of a question of privilege from the hon. member for Hamilton Mountain (Mr. Deans).


Madam Speaker, I rise on what I consider to be a very important matter of privilege. I wish to place before the House a situation which I believe, when carefully considered, constitutes not only a breach of privilege of a Member of Parliament and a contempt of Parliament, but is fundamentally an act of illegality.
I anticipate that a claim may be made that there is precedent which justifies the act which I am about to place before you. I hope to be able to deal with that claim should it arise, however, by referring to certain case law that is already in existence and available both to you, Madam Speaker, and to the House.
I am sure that you are aware that, as a result of the budget brought forward by the Minister of Finance (Mr. Mac-Eachen), certain taxing measures have now been implemented in this country in advance of any law having been passed by Parliament.
I want to suggest that if there is any doubt about the authenticity of that claim one need only call, as my office did, to the Department of National Revenue to ascertain-


Order, please. The hon. member has now been talking for a few minutes but has not given me any indication yet of the basis of his question of privilege. I would ask him to state that forthwith and to elaborate upon it for a few minutes if he feels that he needs to, but I must know the basis of the question of privilege.


Madam Speaker, the privilege I raise is that there is an act in Canada at the moment, that a procedure is
being followed in Canada at the moment, which imposes a tax for which no approval has been given by Parliament and regarding which members of Parliament, in the exercise of their duty, have been ignored. The opportunity for me as a Member of Parliament adequately to represent not only my own view but the views of the people of Canada with regard to the appropriateness of the measure currently in force in the country has not been afforded me. I therefore claim the privilege that 1 have to be given an opportunity in Parliament to deal with acts of Parliament in advance of their implementation.


The hon. member seems to be bringing up a question of the legality of certain things which have been implemented by the government. I would remind the hon. member that the Speaker is in no way capable of determining the legality of certain actions. If the hon. member feels something illegal has taken place, the appeal, of course, is not to the Speaker but is available in some other form.


If you will permit me, Madam Speaker, I would point out that the illegality of the act goes without saying. The question of whether or not I am being given an opportunity to adequately represent my constituents and the people of Canada in dealing with tax measures that the government may or may not bring forward some day, legally or illegally, is not the issue. The issue is that as a Member of Parliament representing people in this country who are having money illegally taken out of their pay packet by employers all across the country, 1 have not had an opportunity to express the concerns of those people in the House of Commons.
I simply ask, Madam Speaker, that you allow me two minutes to explain the point.
There is case law which quite specifically states that it is not appropriate to collect a tax for which there is no law in force. I would refer you, Madam Speaker, to the case in the British Parliament in 1913 of Bowles v. The Bank of England. In that case the Bank of England collected a tax on behalf of the government of England for which there was no law. In the judgment-


Order. The hon. member is obviously arguing along lines which I
