Madam Speaker, since Confederation, and up to 1968, respective Conservative and Liberal Governments respected the rights of individuals to own businesses, land and shares. Under this individual enterprise system, Canada rose to a position of second place in all the world. Individual Canadians were truly free. Since 1968 and the imposition of a government-owned economic system by the Liberal-Socialist Party, Canada has fallen to thirteenth place in OECD and fortieth place in all the world. Individual Canadians are very much less free. Therefore I move, seconded by the Hon. Member for Erie (Mr. Fretz):
That true Liberal Party supporters across Canada rise up and take control of the Liberal Party and throw out the present Liberal Members who make Lenin and Trotsky look like Genghis Khan.

Madam Speaker, both my colleague from Kingston and the Islands and I, over the past few days, have pointed out certain inequities in Bill C-131, the Government's assault on the old age pensioners of the nation. 1 shall not attempt to enumerate these inequities, Madam Speaker, but I want to observe that the sum to be realized in actual savings by the Government through the provisions of this Bill are so limited as to be meaningless, when viewed from the vantage of Government expenditures as a whole. Accordingly, I move, seconded by the Hon. Member for Kingston and the Islands (Miss MacDonald):
That, in view of the fact that Bill C-131 achieves little in the way of savings for the Government and inflicts disproportionate and unnecessary hardship on the
senior citizens of this nation, this House urges the Government to withdraw this ill-conceived and unjustifiable legislation.

Madam Speaker, I rise to move a motion under the provisions of Standing Order 43. In British Columbia the verb "to brie" means foolishly to privatize good government corporations with disastrous consequences. Now we fear that the Canada Development Corporation and its invisible Chairman, Anthony Hampson, who pretends to operate out of Vancouver, will lay off 3,250 workers and will privatize or "brie" the Government's 49 per cent share. Further, Senator Jack Austin, the same one who was defeated in Vancouver-Kingsway, has set up the CDIC whose object will be to "brie" Teleglobe, Canadair, de Havil-land and other corporations, with God knows how many layoffs. Therefore I move, seconded by the Hon. Member for Winnipeg-St. James (Mr. Keeper):
That the Government set up a real investment corporation based in Vancouver with a business, labour, and consumer board accountable to an elected Minister of Parliament and with the object of providing jobs, and furthermore, that Messrs. Austin, Bell, Strong and Hampson should be "briced" instead.

I therefore move, seconded by the Hon. Member for Beaches (Mr. Young):
That this House condemns CP's demolition of the West ed396;-l Toronto railway station as an act of corporate vandalism.

Member for Hastings-Frontenac (Mr. Vankoughnet):
That the Prime Minister cancel his junket and remain in Canada to consult with farm leaders, in light of the fact that farm income is expected to be down by 28 per cent and in view of the fact that the Government's punitive excise tax on farm energy is forcing farmers to the wall, driving production costs up, contributing to inflation, and resulting in higher grocery prices at the supermarket checkout counters.

Therefore, if the Minister is so excited and exhilarated about this issue, I move, seconded by the Hon. Member for Western Arctic (Mr. Nickerson):

In view of the fact that the Minister of National Health and Welfare (Miss Begin) has been the lone Liberal to defend the Government's proposal to limit increases in old age pensions to 6 per cent and 5 per cent over the next two years, and in view of the obvious fact that the Minister's colleagues know how unpopular this piece of legislation is, and are allowing the Minister to swing in the wind and be hung out do dry by the machinations of Keith Davey and Jim Coutts, I move, seconded by the Hon. Member for Hamilton Mountain (Mr. Deans):
That this House calls on all Liberals who do not support this indecent attack on Canada's elderly to defy openly the dictates of the back-room boys of the Liberal Party and demand that this unfair, unjust and indefensible piece of legislation be withdrawn.

Madam Speaker, I rise to express my deep concern on a matter relating to the conduct of the Government. This morning there was a press conference in the Offices of the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development (Mr. Munro).

Imagine my surprise when the Minister was not present at the press conference. Instead, to my

Madam Speaker, the former Secretary of State agreed in this House that the Government's six and five restraint formula should be applied to university tuition fees in light of the substantial contribution of public funds to post-secondary education. Yet university tuition fees have increased more than 16 per cent across Canada in this academic year, and 30 per cent in some Provinces. Therefore 1 move, seconded by the Hon. Member for Annapolis Valley-Hants (Mr. Nowlan):
That the Government take immediate action to ensure Canadian university students will be protected from financial cutbacks to universities, and that tuition fee increases will be limited to 6 per cent and 5 per cent in accordance with the Government's commitment.

Madam Speaker, I rise on a matter of urgent and pressing necessity under Standing Order 43. In view of the fact that the federal-provincial temporary job creation scheme in Saskatchewan excludes workers from existing labour contracts, and since the Program will not even keep up with the number of permanent jobs being lost, I move, seconded by the Hon. Member for Humboldt-Lake Centre (Mr. Althouse):
That this House calls upon the Government to revise its NEED Program in Saskatchewan to allow workers protection under existing collective agreements and to provide for long-term job development.

Madam Speaker, my question is directed to the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development. Today the Minister announced the Government's policy on constitutional development in the Northwest Territories and Yukon. What he did in this announcement was to reject the possibility of provincial status for either the Northwest Territories or Yukon within the foreseeable future. Why has the Government rejected the possibility of provincial status?


Because the Prime Minister is still alive.


Madam Speaker, if the federal Government has rejected anything, it has rejected provincial status now. That is based on realistic factors, such as the tremendous land mass, the limited number of people, and the still relatively narrow economic base.
May I say that our position is based on the realities of the situation. As a northerner himself, I think the Hon. Member knows that there are very few northerners who realistically believe that provincehood, especially in the Territories, is appropriate at this time when they want division. I am talking about the Northwest Territories now. That is a fact. If the Hon. Member is suggesting that they want to wrestle with the question of division now, but want provincehood before that, that seems a ridiculous position and one with which most northerners would never agree.


Madam Speaker, as a northerner I know that people who live in that part of Canada want control of their own affairs, the same as people who live in any other part of the country.


Madam Speaker, my second question deals with the financing of the operation of government in the Territories and in Yukon. At his press conference this morning the Minister rejected the possibility of resource revenue sharing. Instead, he said that it is the policy of the Government to collect all resource revenues and then

November 26, 1982
Oral Questions
hand back dribs and drabs to the Territories as it sees fit. Why has the Minister rejected the possibility of resource revenue sharing?


Madam Speaker, with reference to the Hon. Member's first remarks, may I say to him that not only the native leadership in the Northwest Territories but also the Executive Committee and the entire Assembly, indicated that they wanted the federal Government to indicate, in principle, its commitment to responsible and politically accountable government in the Territories. That is precisely what we have done and that is, therefore, why I can say with considerable confidence, in terms of the northerners whom 1 have met in the last half hour, that they endorse the Government's policy very enthusiastically. May I indicate that they wished they could have received a similar hearing from the previous Government when they made representations of this kind.
As far as the Hon. Member's question about resource revenue sharing is concerned, may I indicate to him that we met the Territories' desire for formula financing. That will allow them to accept political accountability for the moneys spent in the North. They will make their own decisions with respect to priorities for spending that money. That, again, is the real test of responsible and politically accountable government in the North.
In addition to that, we have established the principle of a discretionary fund that will assure northerners that they will have a fund to offset the cost of development in the North. It is the cost of development that is of particular concern right now.
May I indicate that they wanted the discretionary fund to offset the cost of development because that is where the real problem resides right now. It is exploration that is taking place right now. They are going through a stage of expenditure; there are no revenues, simply mammoth expenditures that must be made in order to attain revenues for the future. That is what we are prepared to share with northerners right now.


Madam Speaker, may I put a very simple, brief, supplementary question to the Minister. Does he intend to introduce amendments to the Yukon Act which would give Yukon control over its natural resources? Does he intend to introduce similar amendments which would remove his power of veto over elected members of the Legislature introducing measures affecting the expenditure of money?


Madam Speaker, we intend to amend the Yukon Act to give legal basis to the de facto situation which is there now in terms of responsible government. That is a position which the head of the Yukon government wanted us to take for some time, and I suspect that it has the support, not only of that Government but of the Hon. Member himself.
That will take place. In future, also, it will mean that the Governor in Council at the federal Government level will not have to authorize elections. It will be done by the Commission in Council and therefore by the duly elected people in Yukon. Again that is something which is very much desired in the North.
The amendments to the Yukon Act will take place as soon as the claim of the Council for Yukon Indians is settled. In fact, that was the singular condition to us getting ahead with the amendment of that Act. Dennis O'Connor, the negotiator there, a man whom, I believe, the Hon. Member has backed in terms of his tenure as negotiator, indicated with some optimism that that claim will be settled within the next few months. That being the case, I would certainly hope that we could get ahead with the amendments to the Yukon Act, as the Hon. Member has wanted for some time.


The question concerned the removal of federal control over resources and federal control over finances. The translation of the Minister's answers to both those questions is obviously no.


Madam Speaker, I ask the Minister whether he could part the waves, penetrate all the smoke and mirrors of his announcement, and tell me and other Yukoners whether the federal Government has found solutions to opening the Cyprus Anvil mines, to opening United Keno Hills mines, and to putting miners and other out-of-work persons in Yukon back to work. What is the solution the federal Government is coming up with, with respect to putting the railroad back to work and all those miners who are suffering the tragedy of unemployment in company with 1.5 million other Canadians who are out of work in the country?


Madam Speaker, I just do not believe that Yukoners will appreciate the Hon. Member misinterpreting their representation to this Government for two years. It has been that they wanted formula financing, a type of financing which allowed them to accept their own political responsibility for decisions made on financing, somewhat analogous to the concept of what we do with the Provinces. We have endorsed that.


What about jobs?


We have given them a stake to this degree-a discretionary fund which the leader of that Government, the Conservative Government there, wanted in terms of a heritage fund. That can be provided under discretionary funding.


What about work?


Those are two things which we have acknowledged and done. For the Hon. Member to say that that is not what the people there wanted is a distortion.


Jobs, jobs.
November 26, 1982


As far as the Cyprus Anvil situation is concerned, may 1 say that we have been in intensive negotiations, not only with the Japanese but others, in trying to resolve that. The Hon. Member is fully aware that it requires a labour settlement first, which we still have not attained but are endeavouring to get. May I also indicate that 1 will be talking about the Cyprus Anvil situation when I am in Yukon in the next day or two. In all the time I have been in Whitehorse, Yukon, discussing Cyprus Anvil and trying to get that situation back to work, the Hon. Member for Yukon has not even been there.


Madam Speaker, my question is directed to the Prime Minister. When he announced the formation of the Macdonald Commission it was quite unclear exactly what Mr. Macdonald was going to investigate. In the intervening two or three weeks the whole question has become even more muddled, and yesterday Mr. Macdonald added to the confusion with a press conference. At the press conference he said that he will not give up his corporate directorships-and I assume that applies equally to the other Commissioners-that he will investigate House and Senate reform, that he will take a look at constitutional reform, that he does not know what the Commission will cost, and that in fact he will look into everything with the exception of morality and the state of professional sport in Toronto.
Given that we have a serious economic problem in the country that has to be faced now, could the Prime Minister please tell the House what, in Heaven's name, is this Commission supposed to be doing?


Madam Speaker, I think the clearest answer that I could give the Hon. Member would be to advise him to read the terms of reference which were part of the Order in Council setting up the Commission. If he reads that, he will not only understand what the Commission is intending to do but the Hon. Member will also understand what Mr. Macdonald was saying.


Madam Speaker, I think I do understand what this is all about, but I am not sure that public funding for Mr. Macdonald's leadership aspirations is a good thing.


Oh, oh!


Madam Speaker, surely the Prime Minister knows that we are already funding-we, the people of Canada-the Science Council and the Economic Council, to look at the future and to determine what kind of economic direction we should be taking. We are
Oral Questions
funding the "blue ribbon committee" to advise the Government on immediate and long-range plans for the economy. Now we are going to spend another $5 million on fees and on advice for this Commission to look into all manner of things, not one single one of which relates directly to current economic conditions and how to solve them.
How can the Prime Minister justify spending $5 million right now on this Commission, given that the Commission hasn't the faintest idea what it is doing, and given that it is duplicating work already being done by other groups funded by the Government?


Madam Speaker, the two "givens" quoted by the Hon. Member are precisely not two "givens". The other work which is done within Government is not work which will be duplicated by this Commission. I repeat it is not a "given" that the Commission does not know what it is going to do. The terms of reference are quite clear. It tells them what they are going to do. The Hon. Member is basing his conclusions and his indignation on two wrong premises. I would urge the Hon. Member to read the terms of reference, and to think with a clear mind of the importance of having Canadians, not part of the Government, looking at the long-term prospects for Canada in economic terms and also in institutional terms.
This is hardly an invention. I had occasion previously when I was questioned to refer to the Rowell-Sirois Commission and to the Gordon Commission, for instance. These were very useful works for the elaboration of thought on the future of Canada, ten, 20, and 30 years down the road. This is what we want to have done outside the partisan atmosphere of this House, outside the more short-term preoccupations of departmental duties.
We want a group of distinguished Canadians, hopefully assisted by large numbers of Canadians in financial, academic and labour circles, who will be able to assist the Commission in arriving at a certain number of principles useful for the guidance of this or any government in orienting Canada toward a progressive path in the future. I repeat this has been done before. It is time that it be done again now, and I would urge the Hon. Member to try to depart a bit from his partisan approach to this and to think of the benefit that can come to Canada from it.


Madam Speaker, it is not a partisan consideration. It was the Prime Minister who appointed Donald Macdonald, not I.


And Romanow.


It was Donald Macdonald who said he wanted to be free to leave and run for the Liberal Party's leadership, not I. If there is any partisanship injected into this, it was the Prime Minister and Donald Macdonald who injected it, not we.

Madam Speaker, we have two million people who are unemployed in Canada. There are any number of job opportunities that could be undertaken if the Government had the will to pursue them.


The Prime Minister will appoint them all to Royal Commissions.


To send this group of high-priced individuals at $700 plus a day across the country, to walk around chatting to people about where the future might lead us, is a waste of public funds at this time.
[DOT] (M30)
Why does the Prime Minister not catalogue the various and many jobs that could be created in this country now, the projects that could be undertaken now, and try to get work for Canadians who are unemployed now, rather than create high-priced jobs for Canadians who are already employed?


Madam Speaker, the Hon. Member seems to indicate that his mind can only operate at one level. That is not the case with nor is it the duty of the Government which tries to discharge its functions.
A few weeks ago the Minister of Finance made statements in the House which were concerned with jobs now. The Minister of Employment and Immigration made several announcements concerning jobs now. We think that it is the duty of the Government, and we should have thought also the duty of Parliamentarians in general, to be concerned about the longer term future of Canada and that we should not be so narrow in our approach to reality and our duties as politicians that we are only concerned with today, tomorrow, and next week. We should be concerned with the orientation that the country should take in the future in a very rapidly changing world. This is the job of the Commission.


Madam Speaker, my question is directed to the Minister of National Revenue. Some months ago his Department moved the records of the Hamilton taxation office to Sudbury. My office and the offices of other Members are being swamped with calls from irate business people, tax accountants and taxpayers, who are told that it will take six weeks to get their files from Sudbury. When they call Sudbury they get a recorded message. The taxation staff in Hamilton are being unfairly blamed for the resultant confusion and they refer the irate taxpayers to the local Member of Parliament.
I resent my staff being abused because of a stupid decision made in the Minister's Department. How long will he allow this to continue?


Madam Speaker, first of all, I must say that entirely I disagree with the Hon. Member's conclusion that the decision to decentralize the district office was a stupid one. I would say that before-


Madam Speaker-


Madam Speaker, the Leader of the Opposition also has a habit of jumping to conclusions before hearing the answer, and his conclusions have often been wrong. I would invite him to let me finish my answer.
After this less than courteous interruption by his leader, I can inform the Hon. Member that all objectives have not yet been met to make decentralization complete, and I am sure he will understand that it takes time for the mechanisms involved in office decentralization to become operational, and once that is the case, taxpayers will be able to obtain a better service from their office. However, there is the time factor, and I am sure the Hon. Member will want to ask his constituents to help us by being patient until these services become operational.


Madam Speaker, I have a constituent who called the Sudbury office 14 times and received a recorded message 14 times. At the same time he has a demand for payment of taxes placed on him with the threat of garnishee of his wages. All that he gets from "Big Brother" is a recorded message. How does the Minister attempt to justify having the administrative staff in one location and the records on which they rely in another location? Is he going to give the person who made that recommendation to him a medal for stupidity, because that is what it is?


Madam Speaker, regarding the particular case to which the Hon. Member is referring, and any other cases that may exist,
I would urge the Hon. Member, whenever he is unable to get proper service from our district taxation office-which would surprise me, except perhaps in certain circumstances-to call the minister's office, where we have people who will be glad to answer questions by Hon. Members.
I may also point out that just because files are located in one office and the officer who has to answer queries is located elsewhere, in another office, it does not mean that proper service cannot be provided. The Hon. Member is aware that tremendous progress has been made in electronics, and he should know that with computerized systems, we can bring
November 26, 1982

information located in a file some 400 or 500 miles away, on to a small television screen. Thus, adequate service is possible even if the information is not available in the same office and in the same geographical area. I can assure the Hon. Member that we are maximizing the use of modern technology with a view to provide a better service to the taxpayer.


Madam Speaker, my question is directed to the Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources. It could be answered by the Prime Minister because it was the Prime Minister who promised to extend the gas pipeline to the east coast.
If natural gas were available in the Maritimes in 1983, as promised, Nova Scotians would be protected from the dramatic increases in the cost of fuel oil and electricity for home heating. Since the gas pipeline is delayed to 1986 and beyond, I would ask the Minister of Energy or the Prime Minister if the Government is willing to compensate Nova Scotians for this broken promise, by giving financial assistance to those who must continue to use oil or electricity to heat their homes this winter and for several winters in the future. Does the Minister think it is right that any person in one part of Canada, such as Nova Scotia, should pay more than the national average for energy costs?


Madam Speaker, I wish to tell the Hon. Member that the plans we are working on at this time are much better because we are paying 80 per cent of all the drilling costs off the coast of Nova Scotia. We hope that there will soon be natural gas off the coast of Nova Scotia, so that gas will not have to come from Alberta to Nova Scotia.
Of the $2 billion worth of work in drilling that will take place there in the next two years, the federal Government will pay a large portion of it for the Canadians who drill there, through the PIP Program. We are paying 80 per cent of it.
I hope the Hon. Member will be glad to see that we are doing our utmost to ensure that the resources off the coast of Nova Scotia will be on the shore very soon to serve the people of Nova Scotia.
Of course, in terms of paying the energy costs across Canada, we do not have a national rate. There are different rates across the country because power systems across the country are controlled by the provincial Governments. In terms of natural gas, we have moved the pipeline as far as Quebec. It might not need to go from Quebec to Nova Scotia any more because it is most likely that the drilling program will very
Oral Questions
soon produce natural gas off the coast of Nova Scotia which will serve Nova Scotians first.


That is just the kind of nonsensical answer that annoys people in Nova Scotia and in other parts of Canada. I am talking about the cost which must be borne by individual consumers in Nova Scotia, and the Minister's answers concern Government policy and transfers between provincial Governments and the federal Government. It is the people who are paying for this broken pipeline promise.


Madam Speaker, my supplementary question is directed to the Prime Minister. When he hears his Minister talk about all these arrangements, does he really give any weight to the provision in the Constitution Act which the House approved, Section 36, which provides for equalization of economic opportunity in Canada? Does he not apply that to a situation such as energy costs? How can we have equal opportunities in the Atlantic area unless we have equalization for energy costs? Will he not apply this provision of the Constitution Act to this situation and guarantee that people in all parts of Canada will pay no more than the national average for their energy?


Madam Speaker, it would seem to me that the Hon. Member might reflect on what was done in, and before, the National Energy Policy, when we had precisely the intent of equalizing the cost of petroleum and gas across the country. That was done. That is why there are these huge subsidies to the importers of petroleum in the Atlantic Provinces in particular. This is an aspect which the Hon. Member and his Party have not supported. I am glad that they are coming around to the realization that the National Energy Policy was based on this concept of equalization. Naturally, we cannot equalize every last detail, and the cost must be borne-the cost of transport in particular-within Canada. Even there, we have attempted to equalize as best we can.


Madam Speaker, my question is for the Minister of National Revenue. As some Members have been aware, there is a video game in the United States called "Custer's Last Revenge", which is extremely degrading to the native people, and especially degrading to native women, since it involves rape and other acts of this kind. Can the Minister of National Revenue assure the House that he will use every power of his Ministry to ensure that such perverted trash is not allowed into the Canadian marketplace?

can assure the Member for Ottawa Centre that I am concerned about the importation of this particular video game, and I may add that I have received representations from other colleagues, especially from my Cabinet colleague the Minister of State (Mines) who is also responsible for the Status of Women. This morning, I met the deputy minister of Customs and Excise, and I asked him, in the light of the guidelines governing the administration of Customs Tariff regulations and also in the light of our past experience in this area, to make a thorough study of the initial decision made with respect to the importation of this video game.


Madam Speaker, I would like to direct a question to the Minister of Finance, if I may, and it concerns the increasing number of student loans which have been defaulted because of unemployment. With the rate of youth unemployment up to 21 per cent across Canada, because of the policies of the Government, it is an increasingly serious problem and, more and more, the Government is turning these loans over to collection agencies. Potentially, there were about 10,000 loans in 1980-81 which defaulted. Is the Minister aware of the extent of the problem and, if so, what is he prepared to do about it?


Madam Speaker, the Hon. Member knows the economic situation the western world is facing, as well as the rest of the world. Therefore, when he blames the present situation on the federal Government, in the first part of his question-


How about Bill C-133?


-I would invite him to broaden his sights and see what has happened in the world in the last two years. The Government has taken steps to try to accommodate the difficult time we are going through. We have taken steps to remedy it in so far as we could in co-operation with all economic agents in society. We will continue to do so.
As far as the specific problem to which the Hon. Member referred is concerned, I will investigate the matter and report to him. I will see whether, indeed, there are situations where people are not able to repay debts. I will be pleased to inform the Hon. Member.


I will be pleased not to criticize the Government when unemployment is going up, if the Government, in turn, does not try to take credit for unemployment when it is going down.


I would like to ask the Minister if he is aware that most of these young Canadians want to pay back their loans. Some of them are trying to do it. I know of one case where a person paid back $738 just in interest last year, without reducing the principal at all, and that situation must be duplicated all over the country. Would the Minister consider either a mortgage type of loan subsidy to these students or, better still, a moratorium for those who are unemployed until the economic situation rights itself because of world conditions, not because of the Government's policy?


A moratorium on the interest charges.


I will look into the suggestions brought forward by the Hon. Member. I will examine them very seriously. Indeed, the Government is quite concerned and feels that we should not ask people, who are unable to pay, to make payments on debts that they owe to the Government but which they simply cannot meet at the present time, and that we should show concern and be willing to accommodate them if at all possible. The Hon. Member has made some suggestions and I will consider the matter to see whether they can be acted upon, or whether there are other, better ways of dealing with the problem he has raised. I will be very happy to report to the Hon. Member at the earliest opportunity.


Madam Speaker, I should like to direct a question to the Minister of Agriculture, who is supposed to be looking after the interests of the farmers of Canada. The Chairman of the CNR has been reported in the Western Producer as stating:
-farmers should assume they will have to pay all freight cost increases above the annual Crow benefit payment guaranteed by the Government through legislation to be introduced into Parliament this winter.
May I ask the Minister if that is the position of the Government? Does he support the statement of the Chairman of CN? If this is not Government policy, what is the Government's policy and where does the Minister of Agriculture stand on it?


Madam Speaker, I would like to know where the Hon. Member stands on the issue of what farmers should pay, because he never made it very clear, either.


Oh, oh!


As he knows, the Government has not made a decision on the Gilson Report, but it will in due time. I am not aware of what the Chairman of CNR said.
November 26, 1982


The Minister, in his speech to the Ontario Federation of Agriculture, said that in fact the Chairman of CN had made a very legitimate point that there should a capping of the subsidy paid under the Crowsnest Pass freight rate structure. How does the Minister square his statement here in the House today with the statement that he made to the Ontario Federation of Agriculture?


The Hon. Member is referring to a copy which states on the top of it, "Notes for a Speech".


Oh, oh!


Your Member over there has all the copies of my speeches for the last few years.


It is lucky I have a fireplace at home, Gene!


Oh, oh!


Madam Speaker, once the House settles down and the Minister of Agriculture turns his hearing aid up, I also would like to direct a question to him.


Oh, oh!


That is an inside joke, for the other people who do not know it.
My question relates to the administration of Crown corporations. The Minister knows that the Canadian Dairy Commission went through a very detailed examination by the Public Accounts Committee which reported in 1978 and pointed out that the administration of the CDC, plus parts of its export policy, were very badly handled. Reference was also made to it in the Gibson Report concerning problems in those same areas, as well as the Kotes inquiry. We have just completed studying the Public Accounts Committee report which pointed out quite a few errors in the administration of the Canadian Dairy Commission. Throughout that entire period, the Commissioners and the top management, who were appointed by the Minister, have remained in office, whereas in any other business, if they had made those same types of business mistakes, they would surely have been retired. What is the Government policy for making the top management of Crown corporations, of which there are over 600, responsible?


Madam Speaker, I would like the Hon. Member to be as patient as I will be in waiting for the Public Accounts Report. 1 know that it went through a very thorough study in the last few days of the operations, of Canadian Dairy Commission. I want the Dairy Commission to be run as well as any corporation, private
Oral Questions
or Crown corporation, can be run. I am satisfied at the present time, when making comparisons between the operations of the Canadian Dairy Commission and any other corporation, whether private or other, whether in comparison with Massey-Ferguson, Chrysler or some of the other companies that we have helped, such as Dome, that it is run pretty well and is subject to public scrutiny.
I asked for the inquiries, but I am still of the opinion that one does not assassinate or fire anyone by innuendo. One waits until one has the facts. I have known the men and the Commission, as the Hon. Member said. I am responsible for their appointments. I am responsible for the Dairy Commission. I would put the operations of the Dairy Commission up against any other dairy operation in the whole world. This Dairy Commission has the support of the total dairy industry in Cananda, as does its Minister. Probably no other Minister can say that of his Ministry. He has total support, which the record indicates. When they all say how good it is, am I supposed to condemn it?


Oh, oh!


Hear, hear!


Madam Speaker, the issue is not how good the policy is, it is how the Corporation is being administered and, when there have been four investigations showing mistakes, someone should go.


Hear, hear!


My supplementary question is directed to the same Minister. Since he wants to get into this issue, he also asked for an RCMP inquiry, and that has been delayed and delayed. I want to know when the Minister of Agriculture will bring that RCMP inquiry to a conclusion so that we can really get at the true facts.


Madam Speaker, does the Hon. Member want me to put pressure on the RCMP and interfere with its investigation? Is that what he is suggesting? That is not my prerogative. It is not within my power to do that. I asked for an inquiry. They are making their inquiry. They will not make their report to the Minister of Agriculture, but to the Minister in charge of the RCMP. They make it through the appropriate Minister. That report then comes to me. I wrote to the Minister in charge of the RCMP to have that inquiry conducted.
When one checks the facts, one will not find that they say to the Minister of Agriculture, "There is that kind of inefficiency in there and you should take that action and fire that person or those persons," because it was not that firm. If the Hon.

Member can bring those accusations where there was that kind of wrongdoing in the Canadian Dairy Commission, he should put them on the record. I have had everybody study them. There may have been inquiries. There were certain things said without anything to back them up. I asked for the facts. That is why I asked for the internal audit of the Auditor General. I asked for that because I wanted the facts before I beheaded anybody or did anything like that to anyone. I said if anybody brings out the facts to the Public Accounts Committee-


Order.


Madam Speaker, I wonder if the Minister of the Environment could tell us who is the official who ordered the Judd Buchanan building permit to be issued. On whose specific authority was that ordered? If the Minister does not know the answer to that question, which has been before the House for four days, will he give us an undertaking that he will answer that specific question next week?


Madam Speaker, the building permit was issued by Mr. Racine, as I think is well known. If I understand the substance of the question of the Leader of the Opposition, he knows that. He wants to know if there was some ordering of him to do that. To the best of my knowledge, if that was the case, it would have been as a result of a discussion with his superior, who would be the townsite manager. I do not know the substance of what discussions took place between them before the permit was issued by Mr. Racine.
I have given him the knowledge that I have presently, and I will follow his suggestion. If I can supplement that information, I will forward a communication to him.


Madam Speaker, Mr. Racine, and Mr. Ross the Acting Superintendent, and the Director of Canada Parks West in Calgary have all said they were ordered to do it. I want to know by whom they were ordered to do it. That is what they said, Mr. Prime Minister. If you want to check what is going on in your Government, carry out an inquiry. We would be delighted to do it on the floor of the House of Commons.


Let me
come to the letter of December 23 from the Deputy Minister of Environment Canada to the Member of Parliament for Bow River in which the Deputy Minister indicated that the Buchanan proposal had been rejected. I quote, "The proposed land exchange was not approved". The Minister said yesterday that the Government negotiated a very different proposal and then approved it quietly, secretly. Will the Minister tell the House
of Commons what changes made an unacceptable proposal acceptable?


Madam Speaker, I will reply to the hon. gentleman's question. I do want, however, to point out to him and the House that he has not accurately reported what I said. I at no time said there were secret negotiations which took place after the letter to which he referred. Indeed, the fact is that discussions took place which were certainly not at all secret. On several occasions after that date-on January 4, February 1, June 7, July 5 and again August 30-the minutes of the Banff Advisory Council clearly indicate that there were indications of discussion on the project at that place. I think most Members know that discussions which take place at that Council are communicated to members of the town quite readily, so his allegation which is one made as well by Members on that side earlier this week, that after the letter to which he has referred that somehow there were continuing and secret and unknown negotiations, is simply not the case, and the facts bear that out.
In reference to the earlier part of his question, the other part of his question, there is indeed the letter which he described. Parks Canada, not being entirely sure that the original proposal was one which they would wish to accept, did have a memorandum prepared for Treasury Board which was considered. Treasury Board decided that that proposal was not one which they would accept. As a result of that, Parks Canada did go back and negotiated a different arrangement with the developers which led to the addition of another parcel of land on the part of the developers to that which was the other three, which were being and exchanged with Parks Canada. This narrowed very, very considerably what had been the previous disparity in value, so that was a very significant and substantial change. As a result of that change, Parks Canada officials were confident that the exchange was one which was of benefit to Parks Canada and to the townsite. They felt no need for a further second opinion and they therefore proceeded with the negotiations.


Madam Speaker, if the Minister is so confident that this matter is in the public interest, will he agree to table in the House of Commons the first proposal which was rejected, the second proposal which was accepted, and any representations and any records of conversations that went on between the rejection of a proposal by Mr. Buchanan in the first instance and the acceptance of a proposal by Mr. Buchanan in the second instance?


Madam Speaker, the hon. gentleman has referred to any representations, which is an extraordinarily wide net. "Representations" is the word I think he used. It is not the practice to reveal discussions or negotiations between private citizens pursuing business affairs and governments. As far as I know, it has
November 26, 1982

never been the practice to reveal the kind of commercial information which might be of use or benefit to competitors in the marketplace. That is not something that we have ever done.


Madam Speaker, my question is directed to the President of the Treasury Board. When the Bill cutting the wage increases of Public Servants was before the House last summer, the Government amended it to permit unions to bargain changes within the six and five guidelines. It now turns out that the Government is not permitting this. The Professional Institute of Public Servants is trying to provide increased maternity benefits for some of its members within the six and five guidelines. Treasury Board negotiators told the Professional Institute earlier this month that they were not in a position to respond to the request for increased maternity benefits and that they did not even know when they would be able to respond. Is the Government trying to weasel out of even its minimum commitment to bargaining and, if not, can the Minister give us a firm answer on when his negotiators will be in a position to bargain?


Madam Speaker, the Bill in question was amended by Parliament to give the authority to the Governor in Council to exempt from the Bill collective bargaining in the context of accepting the six and five principle. I have been working with colleagues in Cabinet to develop a set of guidelines which would be made available to the Public Service unions so that they would know the basis on which the Governor in Council would be likely to exercise that discretion. I have discussed this matter with the heads of the major Public Service unions. I told them that I am working actively to get these guidelines developed, and I will show them the guidelines for their input before the matter is finalized. I hope to do so as quickly as possible.


Madam Speaker, I am sure the President of the Treasury Board must realize that time is important on this very specific question. Public Servants have already had their increases cut below the cost of living and they do not want their increases delayed by this type of Government stalling. Why has the Government refused to bargain even within the six and five guidelines, when it has had all summer to prepare itself for this very important issue?


Madam Speaker, as far as I am aware the increases of six and five which are permitted by Bill C-124 are not being held up by the
Oral Questions
matter to which my Hon. friend is referring. The Hon. Member is asking whether it would be possible for agreements to be negotiated of a kind that would not be covered by Bill C-124 because the Governor in Council would exercise its discretion to exempt them. In order to do this, I think it is fair to the public servants in question that they know the basis on which this discretion would be used, so there would not be negotiations on an agreement which later would not be found to be subject to exemption. I am trying to operate in a fair and efficient manner, and I want to get these guidelines worked out as quickly as possible.


Madam Speaker, in the absence of the Minister of Transport I address my question to his Parliamentary Secretary. The Parliamentary Secretary is aware that yesterday, in the wake of the demolition of a building in my riding, the CTC sent a telegram to Canadian Pacific, requesting an explanation for their actions, by ten o'clock this morning.
Has Canadian Pacific respected the deadline set by the Canadian Transport Commission to justify the wanton destruction of the West Toronto railway station? If so, what was the reply to the CTC telegram and, most important, can the Parliamentary Secretary assure the people of Toronto that conditions laid down by the CTC were satisfied before demolition took place?


Madam Speaker, the news of the demolition of the West Toronto railway station came as a complete surprise to the Hon. Member for York South-Weston, to the Minister of Labour, and to me-


And to the Minister of Transport.


-because the three of us worked very closely with the West Toronto Junction Historical Society to preserve this 71-year old building as an historical site.
When the owner of a railway station wants a station removed or demolished, he must apply to the CTC under Section 120 of the Railway Act. Canadian Pacific did this. The puzzling factor in this case is that, a few days before the demolition, CP withdrew this application, and did not apply for a demolition permit from the City of Toronto, claiming that this building is on federal land and does not require such a demolition permit.
CTC acted very quickly by sending a telex to CP yesterday demanding a reply by 10 a.m. this morning. I am pleased to inform the House that s
