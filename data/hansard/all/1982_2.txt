Madam Speaker, 1 rise to move a motion under the provisions of Standing Order 43. Whereas deaths caused by gas equipment mix-ups in hospitals are all too frequent, and whereas the Health Protection Branch and other agencies are already working diligently to reduce such deaths, I move, seconded by the Hon. Member for Grey-Simcoe (Mr. Mitges):
That this House favours a mandatory standard colour coding for all medical gas containers and supply lines.

Madam
Speaker, I rise to move a motion under the provisions of Standing Order 43. Professor Jose Luis Massera of Uruguay was seized and imprisoned for expressing political opinions. He has been tortured and held in terrible conditions in the Prison of Torture, Libertad, Uruguay. The conditions being suffered by Professor Massera are likely to lead to physical and mental illness, and possibly death, if his release does not occur immediately. Therefore I move, seconded by the Hon. Member for St. John's West (Mr. Crosbie):
That the Canadian Government condemn the actions of the Uruguayan Government and demand the release of Professor Massera. These flagrant violations of human rights are in direct contravention of the Helsinki Accord, and steps must be taken to have Professor Massera released and to put an end to acts such as he has suffered.


Is there unanimous consent for this motion?


Agreed.


No.


Madam Speaker, I rise under the provisions of Standing Order 43 on a matter of urgent and pressing necessity. I move, seconded by the Hon. Member for Dauphin (Mr. Lewycky):
That this House cease the impasse over Canagrex and revert to its initial assessment of the Bill which was highlighted by enthusiastic support from the House Leader for the Official Opposition at first reading on December 8, 1981, and further reinforced in the House through agreement in principle on second reading debate where Members of the Official Opposition from Elgin, Moose Jaw, and Provencher, to name a few, supported the legislation, including support for Canagrex's ability to buy and sell agricultural products.


Is there unanimous consent for this motion?


Agreed.

Madam Speaker, I rise to move a motion similar to one I have moved twice before because I have an indication that it might receive unanimous consent today. Since more than 100 million human beings are born into the world each year, most of whom will live in conditions of sub-standard housing, will remain illiterate by United Nations standards, and four-fifths of whom will continually suffer from malnutrition, I move, seconded by the Hon. Member for Oxford (Mr. Halliday):
That the political parties of this Parliament, through consultation, consider the advisability of having the UNICEF organization produce special parliamentary Christmas cards so that Members and Senators may have an appropriate option of sending Christmas cards that depict scenes from Parliament Hill and, concurrent with their good wishes for the Christmas season, be able to assist the needy children of the world.

The $2 billion Arctic Pilot Project promoted by Petro-Canada promised new advances in shipbuilding and marine technology, industrial development for the Canadian East Coast, and access to a world market for Arctic gas. However, this vital project has been seriously delayed and is now stalled before the National Energy Board. Therefore I move, seconded by the Hon. Member for Annapolis Valley-Hants (Mr. Nowlan):

Madam Speaker, my question is directed to the Prime Minister. The Minister of Labour has made very serious allegations against the Court of Canadian Citizenship. The Minister has alleged, among other things, that judges are expected to turn down a number of applicants as criteria for good performance, that there are clashes between the French and English speaking judges, and that there is a deliberate effort made to keep applicants from one ethnic group from being interviewed by a judge who comes from that same group. Does the Prime Minister agree that such allegations attack the integrity of the Court of Canadian Citizenship, and will he conduct a full investigation into the very serious allegations of the Minister of Labour?


Hear, hear!


Madam Speaker, I had not heard of these allegations, but I will take notice of the question, and look into the matter, as the Hon. Member suggests.


We knew we could count on you.


Is that while the Prime Minister is looking into the issue I raised yesterday?
Will the Prime Minister also look into the allegations of the Minister of Labour that there are rules and regulations currently being applied which do not bear any resemblance to the citizenship legislation? Will he ensure that political pressure by Members of the Liberal Party is not being brought to bear on the everyday operation of the Citizenship Courts and the judges who, as 1 pointed out yesterday, are being used by his Party on one hand and, on the other hand, are being attacked by a Member of his Cabinet?


Madam Speaker, that hardly seems like a supplementary question, having looked into the matter raised by the Hon. Member yesterday, and I would not want to give the detailed response which could be given by the Minister today in the House.

December 15, 1982

However, it would seem to me that it is not a matter of using courts when one encourages Canadians to become citizens. That is the-


Ask Ouellet to look into it.


-policy of this Party, to encourage new Canadians to become citizens, and we are happy to be associated with it.


Madam Speaker, my final supplementary question is also directed to the Prime Minister. Since Judge Alice McKeown, the then national co-ordinator of citizenship judges, upon learning of the allegations of the Minister of Labour which were made, by the way, in a letter to the then Secretary of State, said that the credibility of the Court of Canadian Citizenship had been seriously undermined, will the Prime Minister demand that the Minister of Labour publicly apologize to the Court of Canadian Citizenship judges?


Madam Speaker, that is a return to the first question, and 1 said that I would take notice of it and look into the matter.


The same as you did yesterday.


I cannot say more on this day because I do not know what the statement was, the contents of the letter, and, indeed, 1 am surprised that a distinguished judge would use a Member of Parliament as a vehicle for his representations.


It is a she.


If he has representations to make, I should think that he would proceed in another way than doing it in this open way.


Madam Speaker, my question is directed to the Prime Minister. I have in my hand copies of the letters from the Minister of Labour to the Secretary of State which outline in specific detail a very serious castigation of the entire Citizenship Courts, a wide brush accusation of racism and of attempts to improve performance by the number of rejections. I am quite prepared to send these letters over to the Prime Minister. They were circulated to the so-called Met Pac group in his caucus a year ago. That is the Metropolitan Political Action Committee, 1 suppose.
In terms of principle, does the Prime Minister believe that the Citizenship Court judges should have independence in terms of political pressures being put on them by members of his Cabinet?


Madam Speaker, of course i believe that independence should exist, but, not having seen the letter, I cannot begin to see the relationship between the question and the allegation of the letter.


The Minister should resign.


Just from the quotes of the letter I have heard, it would appear to me that a Member of this Cabinet, as it should be the duty of any Hon. Member of this House, would try to improve the citizenship process, and if he or she feels there is anything untoward in the process itself, then he or she should be awake enough, as are our Members, to draw it to the attention of the relevant people.


The Minister should resign.


Madam Speaker, again my question is directed to the Prime Minister. The Minister of Labour has, in effect, made a charge that the Citizenship Court judges are a bunch of incompetents. I do not know whether this has any relation to the method of appointment on the part of the Prime Minister and his Cabinet, being that most appointees are Liberal devotees or wives of former Cabinet Ministers.
I also have a copy of a letter from the Solicitor General to the Minister of Labour, in which he gives a legal opinion that, notwithstanding the fact that there is some role for the Citizenship Court judges to play, no attention has to be paid to those decisions because the Secretary of State has the right to decide on citizenship matters, absolutely, without reference to the Citizenship Court judges. I wonder if that is the policy of this Government, that the Citizenship Court judges have no role to play in the applications for citizenship.


Madam Speaker, 1 think the Hon. Member is using a kind of perverse logic. He accuses the Minister of having made a charge against the Court. From my understanding of the reading of the quotes, the Minister was complaining about certain aspects of the administration of the citizenship laws, and surely that is not the same as making a charge. The Hon. Member, in his own question, accused Citizenship Court judges as being a bunch of Liberal devotees. Is that a charge, Madam Speaker, or is that a smear, or is that a way of showing his respect for the Courts?


Hear, hear!


It is a fact.
December 15, 1982


Madam Speaker, my question is directed to the Prime Minister. Yesterday in the House, the Prime Minister suggested that the NDP should use an opposition day to debate the Cruise missile question. I take it that by making that suggestion the Prime Minister would welcome such a debate and the ensuing vote. I would like therefore to ask the Prime Minister whether he would allow and welcome free expression of opinion and a free vote should the Cruise missile be debated, and not follow the example set the last time the NDP had an opposition day on the Cruise missile and related matters, on April 29, when the Government took all this as a want of confidence motion in the Government and therefore insisted that its Members could not be free, if they wished, to vote against the Cruise missile. Will the Prime Minister in other words, not use this issue as a confidence measure, but indeed allow a genuine free debate and free vote?


Hear, hear!


Madam Speaker, on the first part of the question, indeed I would welcome such a debate. I believe the matter is extremely serious and I certainly share the Hon. Member's concern with the importance of this issue being aired in Canada, it being properly understood and the proper decisions being taken by Government, so on the question of a debate, 1 repeat that I would welcome the debate and 1 hope the NDP will follow up on that suggestion.
Insofar as the latter part of the question about a free vote is concerned, I think the Hon. Member is showing a slight misunderstanding of the rules. If it is an opposition day and there is a vote, under the rules that is a vote of non-confidence in the Government. Of course, 1 would not suggest that these Members should support the NDP in a vote of non-confidence in the Government of which they are Members.


Madam Speaker, many of the Members on the other side, including the Minister of Employment and Immigration, would welcome a free vote.


Hear, hear!


I would like to remind the Prime Minister that there is not, in fact, an NDP opposition day left. The Prime Minister probably knew that at the time he made the suggestion. In view of that fact, plus the fact that he has to regard votes on opposition days as votes of want of confidence, that is all the more reason why he should take up the suggestion we have made time and time again, and indeed follow in the footsteps of his distinguished predecessor in 1958. At that time, the Liberals in opposition insisted on a parliamentary debate and vote in the House on the last most significant inter-
Oral Questions
governmental matter between Canada and the United States in defence, namely NORAD. Will the Prime Minister therefore, in view of all this, set aside a Government day, as the Liberals forced Mr. Diefenbaker to do then, for discussion, debate, and vote on the Cruise missile testing?


Hear, hear!


Madam Speaker, for one part, I would remind the Hon. Member that between now and March 26 there will be seven opposition days. Therefore, it is possible for the New Democratic Party to use one of its days, if its members think the subject is so important, to debate this issue. I repeat, we on this side are happy to debate the subject. In so far as referring to experiences in previous Parliaments is concerned, I cannot say. I do know that under the rules as they stand now, if the Opposition uses one of its days to call a vote it is, by definition, a vote of non-confidence.


Madam Speaker, my question is directed to the Prime Minister. In June, 1958, the late Right Hon. Lester B. Pearson insisted that the Government of the day, under the Right Hon. John George Diefenbaker, set aside a Government day to discuss the very important question of the agreement between the United States and Canada, the NORAD Agreement. In fact the Leader of the Liberal Party at that time said it was normal procedure for matters of such importance to be debated and vote on in this House of Commons. Does that not fly in the face of what the Prime Minister is telling us now?


Madam Speaker, repeatedly since I have been Prime Minister this Government has agreed to put government days aside so that we would debate issues of international concern. This is one example. I remember another example when one of the opposition parties put, forward one day and we put forward another government day so that there could be a two-day debate. This is something we certainly envisage if the House Leaders want to discuss the use of government time in such a way. I repeat, if there is no such discussion, the New Democratic Party, sensing the urgency of this, can certainly move a motion any time on one of its opposition days between now-


He said it was normal procedure.


Well, they are talking of the lack of days. Did they suddenly just discover today that this was an urgent and important matter? Our own Liberal Convention held early in November debated this subject very thoroughly and there was a vote at the end of that. If the Hon. Member wants to know how we voted, she can refer to that convention.


She might rejoin the Party.

I also wish to draw the attention of the House to the presence in our gallery of Mr. Honorius Lacombe, Editor of the French Debates, who is retiring today after seventeen years of dedicated service with the House.

I am sure that Hon. Members will be very grateful to him for continuing the tradition of publishing an objective report of the Debates of this House.

Madam Speaker, 1 have a question for the Minister of Employment and Immigration. Could the Minister, who has been very involved in trying to stop the Garrison Diversion Project, inform the House of the impact for Canada of the vote in the U.S. House of Representatives last evening which, in effect, suspended funding for Garrison?


Oh, oh!


It has nothing to do with his
responsibilities.


I am quite sure that is not under the purview of the Minister's administrative responsibility, having been in that Department which is responsible.


Madam Speaker, in the absence of the Secretary of State I will direct my question to the Prime Minister. It is pursuant to a question asked
yesterday by the Hon. Member for Brampton-Georgetown. Yesterday the Prime Minister indicated that he would take notice of the question that was asked and that he would answer today. He knows that the Minister of State for Multicultural-ism has already given his view on this matter when on "Canada A.M." today, in describing the use of Citizenship Court judges to recruit Liberals, he said "if that helps them think that the Liberal Party is a good Party that cares about them, I am pleased with that."
The document distributed by the Liberal Party at its Convention says very clearly that the purpose of the meetings using Citizenship Court judges is not only just to explain citizenship, but to "bring potential Members of the Liberal Party into contact with established Liberal associations". Will the Prime Minister indicate, Madam Speaker, whether that is a policy on the use of the judiciary which the Prime Minister of Canada supports?


Madam Speaker-


Oh, oh!


As I pointed out yesterday, if trade unions, church groups and others are encouraged to ask Citizenship Court judges to describe to groups they bring together what it means to become citizens, then I think a political party should be encouraged to do that, if that helps people to better understand the political process, what citizenship is all about, understanding politics and voting in elections.


Madam Speaker, if we cannot get an answer from the chief Minister, perhaps I could direct my question to the Minister of Justice and Attorney General. Will the Attorney General, the Minister of Justice for Canada, tell me whether, in his view, it is reasonable for the judiciary to be used in Canada to, "bring potential Members of the Liberal Party into contact with established Liberal associations"? Is that a tradition of the independent judiciary as he knows it?


Hear, hear!


Madam Speaker, I think that is just another way of asking the same question which my colleague has just replied to.


Oh, oh!
December 15, 1982


Madam Speaker, I have a question 1 would like to direct to the Prime Minister. It concerns the status of the Task Force report relating to the Atlantic fisheries. I am sure the Prime Minister is aware of the difficult conditions which exist in the Atlantic fisheries because of the delay in making public the report of the Task Force which dealt with the Atlantic fisheries. My question relates to the Government and Cabinet policy with respect to such public inquiries.
What is the position of the Prime Minister with respect to disclosure of parts of the report which are made known to the public in various ways by leaks from the persons involved in the Task Force and by the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, himself? He must know this creates a state of confusion. What is he going to do about it? And what is his policy with respect to these leaks and the misinforming of the public on such a vital matter?


Madam Speaker, the Hon. Member is asking about our policy on leaks. Our policy is to condemn them firmly.


Madam Speaker, the Prime Minister has just condemned his own Minister of Fisheries and Oceans because he is responsible for the leaks in an interview with a correspondent in London, England, when he disclosed certain vital aspects of the recommendations made by the Task Force on the Atlantic fisheries. Will the Prime Minister, knowing the difficult state of the Atlantic fisheries, indicate to those persons intimately involved with that troubled industry, what the Government proposes to do? When is it going to make the recommendations public? When is it going to come up with a policy to resolve some of the problems? Or is he just going to let the Atlantic fishing fleet flounder on a sea of government indecision?


Madam Speaker, 1 heard, and so did you, the Minister of Fisheries answer that very question yesterday when he dealt with the Kirby Report, and he even referred to the Pearse Report, and indicated it was before the Government, and that their recommendations would be brought forth. That was the answer the Minister gave. I am not quite sure why the Hon. Member is asking a repeat of the same question.


My question is also directed to the Prime Minister. I would like to know how
Oral Questions
he reconciles his penetrating philosophical views about "the anti-democratic reflex reactions of the Liberal flocks of sheep", when they flip-flopped on Bomarcs in 1963, with the independent action of the Hon. Member for Ottawa-Vanier who "raised his voice against the dictatorship of the Leader", and last week voted against Bill C-133, only to lose his very membership on the relevant Standing Committee on Miscellaneous Estimates.


Madam Speaker, as a matter of curiosity, when the Hon. Member said, "raised his voice against a dictator", who was he quoting from?


Madam Speaker, perhaps the Prime Minister has selective amnesia. It sometimes inculcates the very interesting mind of the Prime Minister. I am quoting from the Prime Minister's article in "Cite Libre" of April, 1963, when the then philosopher was commenting on the dictatorship of the then Prime Minister, Mr. Pearson. My supplementary, Madam Speaker, is that in that article the Prime Minister of today, as a philosopher then, wrote, and 1 quote:
I notice amongst the old guard Liberals a degrading cynicism that remains unchanged; amongst the young Liberals I observe the same obsequious-


Order. Order! The question period is to entertain questions, not long quotations.


My question is very short and very much to the point, and it very much involves the whole political morality of this Government.

And to continue the quotation, which the Prime Minister wrote in his own hand-


Order. Order!


I would like to ask the question.


Order. Order! I can certainly give the floor to the Hon. Member to ask the question, but not to debate and not to make lengthy quotations. And I am not treating him in any other way than I am treating other Members of the House.


Madam Speaker, I will try to observe your restrictive stricture.


What is the question?


My question to the Prime Minister, Madam Speaker, is this. Having developed an interesting reputation for political philosophy before he became a practising politician, why has he changed his mind from the article in 1963 when he talked about "old guard Liberal cynicism", and he, God forbid, "never trampled on democracy"? is not what

happened to the Hon. Member for Ottawa-Vanier a trampling of parliamentary democracy, or has the Prime Minister just joined the "old guard" ranks of Liberal cynicism?


Hear, hear!


Madam Speaker, the Hon. Member is confused. In his first question he referred to an article of some 25 years ago, I guess, or 20 years ago, and it cannot be all that urgent a matter. In the second part of his question, between quotes he indicated that the Member for Ottata-Vanier had, "raised his voice against a dictator". I was asking the source of that quote. 1 suspect the Hon. Member has made those quotations up as he makes up a lot of his questions.


Oh, oh!


I will be raising a point of privilege, Madam Speaker, at three o'clock. 1 will read the whole speech. I give you notice now.


Order. Order! 1 really wonder what has come upon the Hon. Member. He has had an answer. The Hon. Member for Selkirk-lnterlake.


Madam Speaker, my question is directed to the Right Hon. Prime Minister who has stated three to four times in this House in recent weeks, including this afternoon, that he views the Cruise missile matter as serious, yet over the past nine months he has tried to defend his Government's decision to permit U.S. Cruise missile testing in Canada as part of an effort to achieve arms control agreements. But as early as 1974, U.S. military planners, including Admiral Holloway, then Chief of U.S. Naval Operations, argued for the Cruise missile because it could be deployed covertly and thus make any arms control verification meaningless. Given this information, will the Prime Minister now make a commitment to stop fuelling the arms race by refusing to allow Cruise missile testing in Canada?


Madam Speaker, I must point out to the Hon. Member that I do understand the concern shown by himself and by many Canadians on the testing of the Cruise missile in Canada, if that is indeed to happen, and which has not been decided yet. That is a matter which is being negotiated in the form of an umbrella agreement with the United States. I understand the concern. I want to point out, as 1 did to one of his fellow members of the New Democratic Party the other day, that this is part of our participation in an alliance, and, if we refuse to
take some role in the alliance, we are either hypocrites because we are supposing someone else should take that role, or else we should withdraw from the alliance. I have not heard his party suggest with any unanimity that we withdraw from the alliance.
As to the Cruise itself, I want to point out that one of the reasons why we have followed this policy which we are debating now is that the Cruise, by its very nature, cannot be a first-strike weapon. The Cruise delivery time is two to three hours, depending on where it is launched from. It cannot be a first-strike weapon, it can only be a retaliatory weapon, used in cases where someone else started a nuclear war, or a war that we feel is going to mightily destroy the alliance. That is a basic point. If the Hon. Members were lobbying against the Pershing or something else, I would understand it more because I suppose conceivably it could be a first-strike weapon. But when you are talking of a missile the delivery time of which is three hours, Madam Speaker, I do not see how the Members over there, or anyone in good faith, could suspect that this is one way in which our side wants to start a war.


Hear, hear!


Madam Speaker, I submit that the Prime Minister has become a born-again militarist.


Oh, oh!


That will be the frosty Friday.


Madam Speaker, given the Prime Minister's obvious disregard for the damaging impact of Cruise missile deployment on future arms control operations, and given that his mind is so obviously closed on this matter, could he tell the House why he wasted the time of the leaders of Canada's major Christian churches who met with him yesterday for the express purpose of changing his Government's position on Cruise missile testing and participation in MX development?


Madam Speaker, they asked to meet me. I do not think it was their assessment that I wasted their time. We had a rational, intelligent discussion. I am sorry the Hon. Member is unable to carry on that kind of discussion. When he calls me a militarist, Madam Speaker-obviously we are a member of an alliance. We are not non-aligned, we are members of NATO. If that makes us militarists, because we are not absolutely neutral, so be it. But then I challenge his Party to get up and say now that they are not militarists in that sense, that they want to get out of NATO.


Hear, hear!
December 15, 1982


Madam Speaker, my question had been intended for the Minister of Consumer and Corporate Affairs. Perhaps I could direct it instead to the Minister responsible for small business.
The Minister of Consumer and Corporate Affairs has broken his word to the House of Commons and to retailers in Canada. He gave assurances to this Parliament back in January, 1981, that he would not prosecute those businesses who still choose to deal in imperial measurement, perhaps along with metric measurement. Will the Minister call off his colleague and stop force marching Canadians into metric and into the courts?


Madam Speaker, the retail gasoline industry met with the Minister on a number of occasions, and had a committee, as the Hon. Member is aware, which oversaw the transformation from the imperial system to the metric system. That committee stood down earlier this year because conversion had taken place in about 99 per cent of the cases. It is possibly damaging to certain competitors of those who seek to infringe the law, and therefore the Minister has taken steps to apply the law.


Surely, Madam Speaker, even the Parliamentary Secretary is not naive enough to believe that there are not many upset Canadians who are being forced to deal in metric, not only in the gasoline retail trade but in many other sectors of metric conversion.


Madam Speaker, the Parliamentary Secretary will know that the Metric Commission is sending out a five-colour brochure, reported to have cost more than $100,000, with every family allowance and pension cheque, wherein it is stated that metric conversion is voluntary in Canada and that we in this country must go metric because the United States is going metric. Both statements are untrue.
Will the Parliamentary Secretary bring to the attention of the Minister that his own Department should stop this Metric Commission from publishing false and misleading advertising?


Madam Speaker, I do not know where the Hon. Member gets the impression that metric conversion is voluntary in certain sectors; it is part of the Weights and Measures Act and the Minister has a responsibility to apply that law. Further, Madam Speaker, given the fact that all young people in this country these days are educated in the Metric system I have a great deal of difficulty understanding-

Madam Speaker, the Prime Minister is meeting with the President of Pakistan this week and, as the Prime Minister knows, there is a great deal of fear that Pakistan is a country determined to develop a nuclear weapon. Will the Prime Minister tell the House what he hopes to accomplish in his meetings with the President of Pakistan, and is he going to urge him to sign full scope safeguards and sign the nuclear non-proliferation treaty? If the President of Pakistan does not agree to do that, are we going to continue our policy of refusing to deliver nuclear fuel or any other nuclear implements to Pakistan?


Well, Madam Speaker, without going into the details of what has happened over the past years, I can assure the Hon. Member that in our past negotiations with Pakistan we stood pretty firm in ensuring that they would not become a nuclear state with Canada's assistance. That remains our position. Of course we will discuss that subject with him again, and it would be our desire that Pakistan and many other countries sign the non-proliferation treaty.
The Hon. Member asks what other subjects will be discussed. There will be many, but I am sure as a front-line state Pakistan will be willing to discuss with us the problems arising from the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, a matter which I understand has caused concern even in the mind of the Hon. Member, preoccupied as he is with the leadership question.


Oh, oh!

Ora! Questions


Madam Speaker, Canada ended nuclear co-operation with Pakistan in 1976 when they refused to accept full safeguards in connection with our nuclear reactor in Karachi, but we still have Canadian technicians working on a Candu nuclear reactor in Argentina; we are still shipping them nuclear fuel bundles; we are still cooperating with them in the nuclear sense even though they have threatened to construct nuclear weapons.
Could the Prime Minister explain to the House the apparent contradiction between our policy with respect to Argentina and the policy he says we are still going to implement with respect to Pakistan?


If I understand the Hon. Member correctly, Madam Speaker, he is supporting the position this Government took in the past as regards nuclear and non-nuclear co-operation with Pakistan. I am grateful to him for having reminded the House of that.
As far as Argentina is concerned, it is another case which has been answered in detail by the present Minister of Justice when he was Secretary of State for External Affairs. Just to refresh the Hon. Member's memory, it had to do with the fact that if we were unilaterally to denounce our agreement with Argentina now, then we would be doing away with all safeguards. They are bound by the safeguards agreement we have now. Since the first signing of agreements in the early 1970s we have attempted to heighten the level of those safeguards and we have not been successful in every case. But to follow the course advocated by the Hon. Member would mean that there would be no safeguards at all with the material and the technology which has already been transferred to Argentina.


Madam Speaker, my question is directed to the Right Hon. Prime Minister. Yesterday afternoon there were two groups of people here. One came representing the churches of Canada, seven national leaders, and at the same time Dr. Brandt from Germany and his commissioners were in the House of Commons. I think that was a very significant event. I feel that both came speaking with a prophetic voice.
This morning the Brandt Commission made a statement which called for urgent action to discuss means to increase world-


Order, order. The Hon. Member should be asking a question, not quoting from a report.


1 would like to ask the Prime Minister, without that much preparation, whether he is prepared at this moment to give a short answer on how he reacts to the Brandt statement this morning asking for greater liquidity, to reverse the decline in world trade and to alleviate the mounting burden of
debt around the world? Does he have a feeling about how Canada can respond?


Madam Speaker, I know Members of Parliament had the privilege of discussing all these subjects with Mr. Brandt and his colleagues, and I discussed them with them the previous day. I think the Hon. Member knows that Canada has been responding and has been taking positions which the Brandt Commission recognizes as showing the proper kind of leadership. Naturally they would want us to do more.
Mr. Brandt and his colleagues suggested the convening of a Cancun-type conference and were very profuse in their congratulations to Canada for having played a leading role in the Cancun Conference. If the Hon. Member is really trying to find out whether Canada is on the same wavelength as the Brandt Commission, the answer is that we have been saying for a long while that the North-South problems are very grave and that they are linked not only to the peace of the world but to economic recovery. We have been saying that. We believe that, but it does not mean that we can give Mr. Brandt or any other organization a blank cheque on the future.


Madam Speaker, the House of Commons is changing its rules at this time. Would the Prime Minister be willing to ask the Government to set up a Standing Committee to study the North-South question steadily, the same way the Brandt Commission has extended itself?


Madam Speaker, we just had a task force of the House, chaired by, I believe, the Hon. Member for Gloucester, which issued a report on this very subject. 1 think the findings of that task force are still worthy of interest, and certainly they have been studied by the Government in determining its policies.


Madam Speaker, my question is directed to the Minister of Finance. This morning there were reports in the newspapers which indicated that the Minister is changing his position on the size of the federal Government's deficit for the purpose of funding direct job-creation programs. This comes at a time when the deficit is at the particularly high level of 40 per cent of federal Government revenues.
Would the Minister explain to the House why he is reversing himself on this and considering a further increase in the size of the deficit, rather than encouraging Canadians across the country to create jobs through tax incentives designed to generate about as much revenue as the apparent tax costs would be?
December 15, 1982


Madam Speaker, a few weeks ago, in answer to a question of a similar nature, I indicated to the House that, as I was going to proceed with numerous consultations for the preparation of the budget, obviously there would be all kinds of speculations in the press about the options I would tend to entertain as the Minister of Finance. 1 said that 1 would not comment on those speculations because I was convinced that they would go in all kinds of directions. I should like to advise my hon. friend right away that he will probably see other articles in the next few weeks indicating a contrary direction. The advice I can give him is that he should read all of them as pure speculation. As far as the specific point he raised is concerned, I will take it as representation in the preparation of the budget.


1 hope, if the Minister of Finance raises this with his colleagues from the Provinces tomorrow, that he will let the House in on the secret which he apparently wants to hold off until the budget.


Madam Speaker, let me give the Minister an example of what I have in mind, the type of tax incentive to which I was just referring. Would he consider a tax credit, for example, of $5,000 against a portion of costs incurred in home renovations completed over the next six months? Obviously this would help the construction industry. It would stimulate expenditures on furniture and wood products with a high Canadian content and a high labour content, and it would be spread throughout the country. Would the Minister give consideration to this type of plan since it is likely to be more effective than large Public Works programs directed by bureaucrats here in Ottawa, and far broader and more efficient than the current CHRP direct loan program which requires a bureaucratic approval in each case?


Madam Speaker, I thank the Hon. Member for his interesting suggestion. I would only remind him that we already have in operation a program for home renovations which provides $3,000 grants and which has generated something like $175 million of investment by the private sector. I do not think he has invented the wheel in his suggestion. He only wishes to add more money to it; I will bear that in mind in the preparation of the budget.


You do not understand the difference.


Madam Speaker, 1 wonder whether the Prime Minister could confirm that on November 5, 11 days after the announcement by Mr. Michael Pitfield of his intention to resign as Clerk of the Privy Council, the Government passed an Order in Council PC
Oral Questions
1982-3439 to raise Mr. Pitfield's salary from the eighth decile D-M 3 level to the tenth decile D-M 3 level.
Will the Prime Minister confirm that that action had the effect of increasing Mr. Pitfield's pension by $1,500 to $3,000 per year at a time when the Government was acting to reduce the pensions of other Canadians?
Would he also confirm that Mr. Pitfield's salary has been increased 9.28 per cent since the introduction of the six and five guidelines?


Shame, shame!


No, Madam Speaker, I cannot confirm that but I will be happy to look into it. As regards the passage of that Order in Council, my recollection is that it was done effective April 1. I may be subject to correction on that, but it seems to me that that is an action which is taken as regards all Deputy Ministers, all Order in Council appointees. They are done every year on recommendations of the Special Committee from the private sector appointed to advise the Government on senior salaries. If the facts as quoted are correct, 1 can assure the House that the action was taken as part of an increase given to all senior public servants.


Madam Speaker, is the Prime Minister telling us that since the introduction of the six and five principle for ordinary Canadians, senior public servants, on average, generally, have been receiving salary increases in excess of 9 per cent as is the case with Mr. Pitfield? Is that what he is telling us? Also, would he tell the House of Commons on what authority he acted?


Madam Speaker, on the first part of the question, the answer is no, that is not what I am telling the Hon. Member. If he looks at my previous answer he will see that he is making up the suggestion and not basing it on the facts.
When the Hon. Member asked me on what authority, I indicated that at least the moral authority came from a committee of private sector people which was set up more than a decade ago and which I believe was called the Kline Committee. But as far as the legal authority is concerned, it was the authority of the Governor in Council to recommend to His Excellency the Governor General, the salary levels of Order in Council appointees.


Madam Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Finance. On October 27 the

December 15, 1982
Point of Order-Mr. Epp
Minister announced that he was deferring any changes in the federal sales tax proposals until May, 1984. Can the Minister give this House absolute assurance that he will not try to introduce these changes piecemeal, product by product in the interval, say, for instance, in lumber and building products?


Madam Speaker, I can tell the Hon. Member that I am not contemplating any such step. He knows, however, that the task force has been agreed to. It is being set up, and consultations will take place. Obviously if there was unanimity on the task force in the private sector that certain steps would be taken, I would want to look at the advisability of proceeding with certain steps, but I can tell the Hon. Member that neither my Department nor myself is considering any such step at the present time. We have never discussed this matter.


The Hon. Member for Provencher.


Madam Speaker, I would like to direct my question to the Minister of Transport-


I am sorry, I thought the Hon. Member was rising on a question of privilege, of which he had given me notice. Questions of privilege are not exactly in the order in which I received them, but he was the only Hon. Member rising. I would just like Hon. Members to allow me to put an end to the Question Period, and I will do it this way.


I have the honour to inform the House that a message has been received from the Senate informing this House that the Senate have passed Bill C-140, an Act for granting to Her Majesty certain sums of money for the Government of Canada for the financial year ending the 31st March, 1983.


Madam Speaker, I want to raise a question of privilege of which I gave you written notice today. I would ask you, Madam Speaker, to take a look at yesterday's Hansard at page 21585. You will note that Hansard records my name in two different places and that I was rising on a point of privilege. Circumstances being what they were yesterday afternoon, a vote was called by you and with the ringing of the bells there was no opportunity for me after ten o'clock last night to raise my question of privilege, and it is for that reason that 1 do so today.
Yesterday during the events of the afternoon there was an exchange between myself and the Hon. Member for Restigou-che (Mr. Harquail) during which the Hon. Member for Resti-gouche, I presume wanting to participate in the debate at that time, was trying to get your eye. I suggested to him, as there were exchanges across the floor, that he should not rise and not further embarrass himself. The Member for Restigouche made a comment which I believe was, first, unparliamentary and, second, I believe it was obscene.


Order, please. Just to put this procedure more in conformity with our rules, the Hon. Member should be rising on a point of order and not on a question of privilege. Otherwise I need not hear him and can tell him that he does not have a question of privilege. The Hon. Member does have a point of order. If he wants to raise a point of order, I will entertain it.


I have a question of privilege, Madam Speaker, which takes precedence over a point of order.


Madam Speaker, 1 will take your advice. I will continue where I left off. I believe the comment was, first, unparliamentary and, second, I believe it was obscene. Third, I believe the comment was unworthy of any Member in the House, to raise matters in the manner in which that one was raised.
1 notice that the comment is not recorded in Hansard. 1 have checked with a number of my colleagues on this side of the House to confirm whether or not they heard the comment made by the Hon. Member for Restigouche. A number of them assured me both yesterday and today that they heard the words used by the Hon. Member from Restigouche. Even though the matter is not recorded in Hansard, it is important the words of Hon. Members in this House be taken as the truth. Even though the words were not recorded in Hansard- and I have no intention of repeating them and thus entering them into the pa
