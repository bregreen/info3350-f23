Madam Speaker, in view of the fact that, because of the limited space available in our three veterinary colleges in Canada, less than 15 per cent of the eligible applicants to the veterinary course can be accepted, resulting in an undesirable shortage of veterinarians in all phases of the profession, including the civil services, and in view of the fact that the Atlantic provinces have been procrastinating for several years now as to where the fourth veterinary college will be located in the maritimes, I move, seconded by the hon. member for Erie (Mr. Fretz):
That the Minister of Agriculture, whose department would be allocating some 50 per cent of the capital cost toward a new college, take the bull by the horns and come up with a suitable location and let us get on with this much-needed facility, or use the money to expand existing facilities and increase enrolment.

Madam Speaker, the only sizeable group of people who are assisted by the budget are senior civil servants and senior officials in Crown corporations who received a very significant increase in net pay as a result of the reduction of the over-all tax rate from 63 per cent to 50 per cent. I therefore move, seconded by the hon. member for Brampton-Georgetown (Mr. McDermid):
That the President of the Treasury Board, in negotiating salary increases for senior officials in the government, take into account the enormous benefit they have already received as a result of the change in tax policy and that any indexing be reduced by the effect of the income tax changes on their take-home
pay.

Madam Speaker, my motion under Standing Order 43 should have no difficulty in receiving the unanimous consent of the House.
Yesterday Canadians received the great news that Gerry Sorensen of Kimberley, B.C., won the gold medal in the women's downhill race at the World Alpine Ski Championships in Austria-Canada's first gold medal since Nancy Greene won it in 1968.
Fellow Canadians Laurie Graham and Dianne Lehodey finished third and fifth respectively, giving Canada a total of three of the top five placings.
1 therefore move, seconded by the hon. member who represents Gerry's home riding, the hon. member for Kootenay East-Revelstoke (Mr. Parker):
That this House congratulate Ms. Sorensen and other members of our national women's downhill ski team for their outstanding performance in this world championship race, and extend our best wishes to our national men's downhill team for equal success in their championship race next Saturday.


Hear, hear!


Members want to show their appreciation with their applause. Thank you, very much.


Madam Speaker, in view of an announcement at this hour in Montreal that the Automobile Protection Association is launching, on behalf of all motorists in the province of Quebec, a $3 billion class action suit against the major oil companies for alleged price fixing, I move, seconded by the hon. member for Nepean-Carleton (Mr. Baker):

February 4, 1982
That this House applauds the initiative taken by the Automobile Protection Association and, further, that the Ministry of Consumer and Corporate Affairs take the oil companies to court to clear the air on behalf of all Canadian consumers with respect to price fixing.

Madam Speaker, the government's mismanagement of the economy, causing inflation and high interest rates, has placed the farming community of Canada in a disastrous situation. Many have been forced off their land and many, many more are on the brink of bankruptcy. We face a similar situation to that which we experienced in the dirty thirties. Therefore I move, seconded by the hon. member for Peace River (Mr. Cooper):
That, recognizing it is in the national interest to retain farmers on the land as efficient producers, this government make the necessary amendments to the Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act to make it an effective instrument to be used by farmers to prevent bankruptcy.


Is there unanimous consent?

No.


Madam Speaker, the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans (Mr. LeBlanc) has made many unnecessary and unreasonable changes with respect to the licensing of and the conduct of licensees engaged in the fishing industry. In many instances these regulations have been extremely expensive and have not conserved a species, nor have they improved the health standard of the product. Therefore 1 move, seconded by the hon. member for Fundy-Royal (Mr. Corbett):
A.	That no changes in regulations pertaining to the Fishing and fish processing industry be put in force until there is full consultation with the participants in the industry so that the full impact and benefit or penalty of the change may be thoroughly understood by officials of the Department of Fisheries and Oceans, and by the fishermen themselves.
B.	That an immediate review of existing regulations and licensing be undertaken to remove some of the obstacles to efficient and viable practices in the industry.

Madam Speaker, I rise under the provisions of Standing Order 43 to ask for the unanimous consent of the House to deal with a matter of urgent and pressing necessity. In view of the fact that the Northern Canada Power Commission has threatened to cut off the power for residents of Field, British Columbia, because the people have been withholding payments as a protest, in view of the fact that these people are protesting the fact that their power rates are four times higher than in comparable communities in British Columbia, and in view of the fact that the Minister of the Environment (Mr. Roberts) has promised to negotiate a rate reduction for the community of Field, I move, seconded by the hon. member for Kamloops-Shuswap (Mr. Riis):
That this House instruct the Department of the Environment and the Northern Canada Power Commission to negotiate rate cuts for the community of Field and guarantee those residents that their power will not be cut off.

Madam Speaker, thousands of pensioners of moderate means have chosen to forgo income in the early years of their retirement in order, through RRSPs, either to provide spousal incomes or to protect against future inflation. For this government, itself the chief cause of that inflation, to take away from these self-reliant Canadians the $1,000 pension income deduction is disgusting. I move, seconded by the hon. member for Mississauga South (Mr. Blenkarn):
That this viciously inhumane proposal in the budget be immediately abandoned.

Madam Speaker, 1 rise to intercede on behalf of Canada's 12 million taxpayers-16 million, if we have the inflationary tendencies of the Minister of Finance (Mr. MacEachen)-who are completely and utterly confused by the changes, flip-flops, withdrawals, retreats, amendments, grandfather provisions, exclusions, deductions and tax credits. I understand that the tax guides presently in the hands of taxpayers are incorrect but that the tax tables are accurate. I therefore move, seconded by the hon. member for Pembina (Mr. Elzinga):
That the status quo be in effect in every respect for the 1981 tax year and that changes proposed in the ill-fated MacEachen budget be not considered and given the hoist permanently.


Is there unanimous consent for this motion?


Agreed.


No.


Madam Speaker, whereas I and others on the Progressive Conservative fisheries committee heard repeated complaints from fishermen in New Brunswick last week that department officials are not communicating with fishermen, I move, seconded by the hon. member for Vancouver South (Mr. Fraser):
That the terms of reference of the Kirby task force be broadened to include specific means by which the communication of policy and the effect of regulations can be improved so that fishermen are not excluded from essential information and, also, that procedures be established to hear and implement proposals from fishermen prior to making policy decisions.


Is there unanimous consent for this motion?

Oral Questions SMALL BUSINESS


Madam Speaker, in view of the fact that both the Canadian Chamber of Commerce and the Federal Business Development Bank have stated that a lack of skilled labour is the number one problem facing many members of the small business community, I move, seconded by the hon. member for Pembina (Mr. Elzinga):
That the federal government encourage more participation by women in apprenticeship programs and industrial training in order to deal with the increased skilled labour shortages which will face this country in the future.


Is there unanimous consent fot this motion?

Madam Speaker, I rise on a matter of urgent and pressing necessity. While all members of the House recently applauded the outstanding performance of our distinguished athletes in their downhill ski races in Europe, we are just appalled at the dismal performance of our Minister of Finance (Mr. MacEachen) as he attempts to snow the Canadian people and take our economy downhill with record high inflation, unemployment, and interest rates. Therefore I move, seconded by the hon. member for The Battlefords-Meadow Lake (Mr. Anguish):
That the Prime Minister disqualify the Minister of Finance and eliminate him from competing in any further races, leadership or otherwise.


Is there unanimous consent for this motion?


Agreed.


No.


Madam Speaker, my question is directed to the Minister of Industry,

February 4, 1982
Oral Questions
Trade and Commerce who will know that a study for his department by Data Resources of Canada estimated 1,030,000 Canadians will be out of work this year. That is an unemployment rate of 8.7 per cent. Also the minister will know that the budget was based on an estimate of an unemployment rate of 7.8 per cent this year. Will the minister tell us which figure is correct-the lower figure on which the budget is based, or the higher figure prepared for his department?


Madam Speaker, what my hon. friend is talking about refers to already published material by Data Resources which is available for anyone to check. I like to think that nobody on either side of the House needs to look at studies of that sort to recognize that we are in a serious situation.


Oh, oh!


We are working to deal with this through programs such as the program in support of technology and enhanced productivity, involving $93 million of expenditure, and in support of microelectronics and advanced production machinery projects, and the programs we announced last week which were in support of auto parts and major appliances sectors. It is important for us to work to deal with the situation, not argue about figures.


Madam Speaker, the government, in defence of its budget based on figures, tells Canadians not to worry about figures. The point is that the problem is known to all Canadians, the problem of Canadians being menaced with the loss of their jobs. The fact that the budget figures are wrong is known to Canadians. I asked the Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce whether his figures or the figures on which the budget was based are wrong. He declined to answer that question. I should like him to tell us whether the budget was based on the assumption of 8.7 per cent unemployment which was forecast by his own department. If it was not, will there be changes in the budget to take account of the fact that it was based on an unemployment projection which was wrong?


Madam Speaker, the assumptions of the budget are set forth in the material published with it, involving forecasts by the Department of Finance with respect to various elements of the economy. My right hon. friend is not referring to a forecast carried out by my department, but to one carried out by Data Resources, something which is public and has already been published. 1 am sure one could Find a range of other forecasts which point in various directions. That is not uncommon with respect to the work of economists. But at the same time there is no doubt we are in a very serious situation with respect to the economy and unemployment. We are working to take
tangible action in the area of job creation, and that is the important thing.


Madam Speaker, what is important when we are dealing with the budget, which will affect the future of millions of Canadians, is whether the budget was based on accurate figures. My question to the minister is very simple. He avoided answering it twice. Is the figure prepared by the consultants for his department wrong, or is the figure prepared as the basis of the budget wrong? Which figure is wrong?


Madam Speaker, the projections on which the budget was based were set forth in documents tabled with the budget at the time the budget speech was presented last November.


Which figure is wrong?


The analysis of Data Resources was done more recently. It was already made public prior to the press report on which he bases his question. If the hon. member wants to do it and is capable of doing it, he can take the two analyses and reach his own conclusions.


Oh, oh!


Madam Speaker, we now have come as close as possible to the government making a clear policy statement. The minister admitted that the budget figures were out of date and that the Data Resources figures are more recent and, consequently, more accurate. An official of his own department, Mr. Thomas McCormack, director of the economic intelligence directorate, said "The worst is yet to come." He also said that "the economy is sliding faster than anyone anticipated." In other words, his own officials not only challenge the figures on which the budget was based but they challenge the government's view of economic consequences in 1982. The minister has admitted the budget is wrong. Will he tell us whether he is proposing changes in this budget to help those 1,030,000 Canadians who are faced with the prospect of losing their jobs this year? Will the minister be proposing changes in a budget that he has admitted is based on out of date figures?


Madam Speaker, I have not admitted that the budget is based on out of date figures. We are dealing with forecasts, and we can find a range of forecasts.


Oh, oh!
February 4, 1982


The important thing is that this government recognizes there is a serious economic situation, a serious situation connected with unemployment-


Who caused it?


-and we are taking tangible action, important steps announced by myself just in the past week or so aimed at creating jobs, aimed at dealing with the situation in a tangible and meaningful way. That is the important thing, Madam Speaker.


This is a recorded announcement.


Madam Speaker, my question is also for the Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce. He will know that there is an internal government document which points out that by March of this year 175,000 more Canadians will be out of work. The minister will also know that the major areas from which those lay-offs are coming are found in the provinces of Ontario and Quebec. Would the minister at least meet with representatives from industry and labour to see if he can find alternatives to these massive lay-offs?


Madam Speaker, I have been meeting with representatives of industry and labour. I am certainly prepared to do so again to exchange ideas on steps to be taken. But just in the past week we have already taken a number of steps aimed at dealing with the difficult situation in sectors that are very important to the economies of Ontario and Quebec, namely, auto parts and the major appliances sectors. Certainly these announcements were very favourably received by representatives of industry and labour.


Madam Speaker, in the absence of the minister responsible for social policy I will direct my question to the Minister of National Health and Welfare. She will know that the government has been talking recently about cutting back social assistance to the provinces. The minister will also know that the parliamentary task force on fiscal federalism unanimously recommended that the federal government should increase its share of social assistance funds to the provinces at a time of economic downturn. Given the fact that we will now have 175,000 more people looking for work by March, will the minister recommend to the govern-
Oral Questions
ment that it accept the recommendation which was endorsed by all parties in this House so that these people can be guaranteed some relief?


Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member for giving me the opportunity to correct a very serious mistake made twice to my knowledge in recent weeks by the Toronto Star. I could send the hon. member a copy of the telex that 1 sent immediately to the Toronto Star which, unfortunately, has not yet been published. I do not know the origin of the mistake.
All social assistance payments in Canada are made under CAP, as my colleague knows. These payments encompass all welfare moneys and all the social services to which the federal government contributes 50 per cent, that is 50 cents on every dollar. These payments have not only been completely protected but in this current year have increased by 19 per cent to date, and we have not yet finished the year. We pay 50 cents on the dollar automatically on all social assistance expenditures. Therefore, I can give the assurance, not only of maintaining the program, but of increasing it tremendously.


Madam Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce. He has tried to imply in his answers today that the study done for his department is just one of many and that there are different figures arrived at by different economists. The fact is that his own director of economic intelligence has substantiated the figures by saying it is likely we will have another 175,000 unemployed by March.
Now, Madam Speaker, the minister knows that if anyone can estimate the effect of the government's announced programs, which the minister has spoken of, and how much they will do to create employment, it is the people in his own department. If his own department suggests we are going to have 1,250,000 unemployed by March, obviously they do not have much confidence in his programs.
However, given the fact that yesterday or the day before the ten provincial premiers unanimously urged that his government take immediate steps to reduce interest rates to get the economy moving, I ask the minister whether he or the government have any new announcements to make to deal with this very serious problem of unemployment?


Yes or no.


Madam Speaker, the comments reported in the press were based on forecasts made by private sector forecasting bodies,

February 4, 1982
Oral Questions
which are available to anyone to read, analyse, and think about. With respect to this difficult situation, just before the first ministers' conference we announced some very important new programs focused over the next two years to support the creation of jobs, for example, $25 million over the next two years in the auto parts sector; a program focused on creation of jobs in the major appliances sector, $ 15 million over the next two years; the extension of designation of communities under the Industry and Labour Adjustment Program, to cover a number of communities in serious difficulty. We also announced a new program with a total budget of $93 million aimed at improving the level of efficiency and productivity of all sectors of the economy, to encourage them to adopt new production processes-


Oh, that is nonsense.


-and machinery, with positive implications for employment. So, we have just taken some tangible and important steps, and I anticipate we will be developing and announcing some further steps in the coming weeks.


The minister has learned a great deal from that former great minister from Windsor, the Hon. Paul Martin. He learned the worst examples of how to try to baffle people.
In that short period of the Conservative government the minister was the financial critic for the Liberal Party and he made a number of speeches criticizing high interest rates. Just today, Madam Speaker, the Bank of Canada announced an increase in the bank rate so it is obvious we are going into a period of rising, not declining, interest rates. That is going to do just what the minister said, increase inflation.
I would ask the minister when the government is going to take steps to reduce interest rates rather than let them go up, as the Governor of the Bank of Canada has done.


Interest rates have come down substantially since-


Oh, oh!


-since their high point last August, a decline of some six points.


Not as low as when you said you would resign.


The over-all thrust of the budget is to create a climate aimed at reducing inflation and the upward pressure on interest rates, to continue this over-all movement we have seen since last August.


Nobody believes you.


Madam Speaker, the minister knows that all the programs which he and the Minister of Employment and Immigration have announced, if they work as the government claims, will only employ a few thousand people. Just today in The Globe and Mail we had announcements of lay-offs by Union Carbide, Cochrane Dunlop, Jarvis Clark-


Order, order. This is the third question where I feel the hon. member is really taking too much time with lengthy preambles. Would he go straight to his question?


Madam Speaker, I ask the minister once more whether the government has any programs which will really turn the economy around with a reduction in unemployment, or are we going to continue each month for the next year to have more unemployment as we have had almost every month for the last year or more?


Madam Speaker, the programs that I have been talking about, including the program announced just before Christmas by the Minister of Employment and Immigration, and intended to have a real and substantial effect on unemployment and create very substantial numbers of new jobs. We are also looking at other types of programs to have additional effects in reducing unemployment and creating more jobs.
At the same time we have to recognize that a major reason for the kinds of lay-offs mentioned by the hon. member is the weakness in the U.S. economy and in the economies of other major trading partners. It is something that, no matter how we would like to do so, we cannot escape completely, even though we have to work to deal with the needs and requirements of our own economy. Certainly the over-all approach of the budget is to create a basis for job creation and economic renewal, reducing upward pressures on interest rates and inflationary pressures. Our over-all purpose is to get these objectives in place, job creation and reducing unemployment. Let us work together to achieve those objectives.


Madam Speaker, my question is to the Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce who knows that one of the industries hardest hit with unemployment is the auto industry. The minister also knows that the U.S.-Canada auto pact was designed 17 years ago with the intention of giving Canada its fair share in the automotive industry. Today we have a record $4.35 billion auto parts trade deficit with the United States. So much for fair play.
February 4, 1982

In view of the fact that the minister has failed in his efforts to improve the situation, will he now take the only step available to him regarding the auto pact, that is, to terminate this obsolete, inadequate and unfair agreement as soon as possible and, at the same time, begin negotiations on a new deal which would be more equitable to this country? Surely we cannot continue to live in the auto industry with that auto pact, losing over $4 billion a year.


Madam Speaker, the record for the period since the auto pact was signed shows very substantial increases in employment over the employment levels at the time the pact was signed, and very substantial increases in investment and production, both in finished vehicles and parts, including very substantial increases in production. The general consensus of those observing the pact has been that, although there are problem areas that have to be addressed, on balance it has worked well for Canada. Because we recognize the various problems that have been identified, we have begun consultations with the United States about improvements in areas that are of concern to us. My colleague, the Minister of State for International Trade, and myself intend to pursue these consultations over the coming months.


Madam Speaker, this is incredible. Is the minister trying to tell us that he is satisfied with the results of the Canada-U.S. auto pact? I would like to have him tell that to the million unemployed Canadians, the unions, the industry, the auto parts manufacturers who are suffering as a result of the inaction by the minister. I have a supplementary question.
Figures also released today by Statistics Canada indicate a 25 per cent decrease in Canadian-made auto parts sold to Japan. Last year the minister said there would be an increase. It is down to $6.6 million, while Japanese automotive imports skyrocketed by 75 per cent to $1.5 billion in 1981. Will the minister now seriously stop fiddling around with consultations and so on and make two major demands of the Japanese if they want to continue with their bonanza sales in Canada. First, increase substantially the Canadian content in Japanese vehicles as many other western industrialized countries have done. Second, encourage Japanese investment in Canada along the lines of the Volkswagen situation. That is not too much to ask.


Order.


Madam Speaker, I have said before in this House that I like to think the arrangement we negotiated with Volkswagen, calling for a very substantial level of Canadian content, much higher than that required for motor vehicle assemblers, as well as very
Oral Questions
substantial purchases from independent parts suppliers, will be a harbinger of similar arrangements with other companies in future.
At the same time I want to tell the hon. member that, in the discussions with Japan on arrangements with respect to restraint of exports which have just begun, the Minister of State for International Trade and myself will ensure that our officials bring very clearly to the Japanese the fact that our economy continues to be in a difficult situation and that the recovery of the North American market for automotive vehicles has not taken place to the extent foreseen prior to this year, and that the kinds of concerns I have mentioned, and which have been echoed by my hon. friend, are very much the kinds of concerns we expect to be taken into account in the response by the Japanese.


Madam Speaker, last week in the House the Solicitor General was very definite in his reply to me that no other benefits or considerations had been given by the RCMP in respect of the Olson matter. I would therefore like to ask the Solicitor General if he was misleading the House, or did he simply not know that the RCMP have offered Mrs. Olson false identity papers, that the RCMP have offered Mrs. Olson full transportation and relocation expenses anywhere in Canada and, in fact, the RCMP drive Mrs. Olson in an RCMP car with an RCMP driver when she visits Okalla prison to see her husband, wait for her, and then drive her home. Are these matters referred to in the agreement which the minister so far has refused to table in the House?


Madam Speaker, I want to repeat what I said to the House before on this subject and what I said outside.


Which version?


There is a sensitive criminal investigation which is ongoing right now, today. 1 do not think it would be in the public interest for me at this time to give any answers to those questions or any details of arrangements that are being discussed and possible arrangements and allegations of arrangements between the attorney general of British Columbia and his people and "E" Division of the RCMP involving other possible criminal activities of Clifford Olson.


Madam Speaker, before I ask my supplementary, I feel obliged to point out to the Solicitor General that these matters are not involved in any ongoing criminal investigation with respect to Olson or any other accomplice.

February 4, 1982
Oral Questions


Madam Speaker, my supplementary is to the seatmate of the Solicitor General, the Minister of National Revenue. Can he confirm or deny that an investigation is taking place to ascertain if a good portion of the income of Clifford Robert Olson, a convicted killer, over the last six years was moneys received from police in regard to information, that a further investigation is taking place to see if the $90,000 already paid to a trust fund can be construed as income and, finally, whether this is being done in spite of a clause in the agreement which protected Olson and his dependants from any tax investigations or any claim of return of any portion of those funds to the Crown?


Madam Speaker, the hon. member will know that it is improper for me to discuss the affairs of any taxpayer in Canada in this House or publicly.


Madam Speaker, I would like to ask the Minister of Transport about press reports, which I suspect were carefully planted, that he will be holding a press conference in Winnipeg at 10 a.m. Monday to announce the strategy for proposed changes in the Crowsnest Pass rate. If that is correct, since the Premier of Saskatchewan has called for a grain summit meeting later this month to which the four western provinces, the Canadian Wheat Board and the Prime Minister have been invited and which, in all probability, the minister will attend, will he at least have the courtesy, and avoid deliberately bypassing the provinces, to delay any announcements until such time as that grain summit has been held? It will include discussions of the Crow rates, so the minister could take into consideration the consultation and discussions at that summit meeting.


Madam Speaker, on the subject of courtesy, I do not think we have a lesson to learn from the government of Saskatchewan. The Premier of Saskatchewan called that summit conference on grain without consulting with the Prime Minister or with any member of his cabinet. Perhaps the criticism should be directed a different way, at least concerning this particular item.
The Prime Minister, in answer to a question by the Premier of Saskatchewan concerning that subject, said that the discussion on marketing and other aspects of grain could very well take place at the conference which is now taking place, and that a decision would be taken then as to the federal participation in the so-called summit conference.
Concerning the subject of an early announcement which the newspapers have reported that I would be making, I can only
quote that the Prime Minister is purported to have said, according to press reports: "I can tell you today that we are very close to a final decision on how we plan to proceed on western transportation. Within a few weeks, the federal government will propose a set of principles, a more precise allocation of funds, and a process of consultation with those concerned, particularly western Canadians."


It is called bringing western Canada to its knees.


Madam Speaker, the minister knows that there is no way that all aspects of grain, such as grain transportation and grain marketing, could be raised at the first ministers' conference. He knows that perfectly well.
The minister has claimed that there is a consensus for changing the Crow rate when two provinces oppose it. The Saskatchewan Association of Rural Municipalities and cow-calf operators also oppose changing the Crow. Therefore the minister's version of the consensus is about the same as that between a bank manager and John Dillinger.


Will the real John Dillinger stand up?


I would like to ask the minister if his bargaining position is that the grain freight rates paid by farmers will double by the end of 1982, triple by the end of 1984 and quadruple by the end of 1986?


Madam Speaker, I am obviously not in a position to reveal the contents of the announcement which the Prime Minister said would be made sometime in February. However, any sort of prediction based on what is not known would not be of great value.


Give him a bodyguard.


This is what my friend, the hon. member, has done for the last week. He has been drawing conclusions from an announcement which has not been made. He speaks about
50,000	jobs which would be lost, without any reference to reality whatsoever. It is just a figure that he picked from the mirror while shaving one morning.
However, concerning the consensus business, I think that in order to contribute to the debate my friend should make a number of distinctions. There is a consensus in western Canada on a change which must take place in order to remedy the coming situation in western grain transportation. There is unanimity in western Canada on that subject, and he knows that very well. Therefore, one will have different degrees of consensus depending on the subject which is debated at any particular time.
February 4, 1982


Madam Speaker, my question is directed to the Minister of the Environment. In view of the fact that the thermal power plants of Ontario Hydro, which currently has an application before the National Energy Board, already emit 410,000 tonnes of sulphur dioxide a year, can the minister tell the House what assurances Ontario Hydro has provided to him that future expansion will include adequate emission controls?


Madam Speaker, Ontario Hydro has made commitments over the next ten years to reduce its sulphur dioxide emissions by well over 40 per cent of present levels. However, I have to say to the hon. member, in all frankness, that the recent efforts of Ontario Hydro to increase electricity exports to the United States in ways which will accentuate and exaggerate the sulphur dioxide problems, and its recent announcement that it would increase nitrous oxide emissions while reducing sulphur dioxide emissions, are statements which cause me very great concern. I think they are reprehensible and regrettable.


Gerry Regan didn't like that.


Madam Speaker, I have a question for the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans. The head of the government task force on Atlantic fisheries, Mr. Kirby, recently stated that he would not hold public hearings. He also, of course, said that members of provincial governments were not the people to judge what is best for their constituents. But in any event he said that in his inquiries there would be no public hearings.
Is that a decision which has been approved by the government, and, if so, why? What has happened to the Liberal theme that it believed in open government and involving the people in a matter which concerns their very lifestyles and their incomes?


Madam Speaker, the problem that Mr. Kirby has been asked to address basically, deals with the question of marketing and the question of processing capacity, whether or not there is excess capacity, and also fleet utilization, particularly the offshore fleet. Mr. Kirby was asked to bring in recommendations in sufficient time to arrive at some decisions, preferably before the summer break. He arrived at the conclusion, which I support, that this could be best done by a working group which would meet those who were principally interested in this area and that there should be as widespread consultation as
Oral Questions
possible. He will not turn what is a very clearly defined task into a royal commission hearing.


Madam Speaker,
I am very intrigued by the minister's reply that Mr. Kirby is to come back with some answers by this summer. As the minister well knows, a cabinet document was supposedly to be completed in January so that the cabinet could make some decisions. However, in any event, the minister has confirmed that there will be no public hearings.
The object of Mr. Kirby's task force is to deal with the fisheries on the Atlantic coast. However, there is no one acting as a co-chairman who represents the fishermen, whether they be offshore or inshore. I would ask the minister whether he would explain to this House why the only other representative who serves as a co-chairman with Mr. Kirby is someone who comes from the management side of the fisheries industry. There is nothing wrong with that, but why are the people who do the fishing, making their livelihood and income from this industry, completely excluded from this commission?


Madam Speaker, perhaps the hon. member would benefit by asking some questions before he repeats a canard which has been expressed in the media. To my knowledge Mr. Nicholson is not the vice-chairman of the task force. Second, I note that Mr. Kirby has approached a very senior representative of a fishermen's organization. I have not been told if Mr. Kirby has been successful in enlisting the participation of this individual or another one from that same organization. However, I know that one major fishermen's organization has been approached, and we are waiting for an answer.


Madam Speaker, I would like to ask a question, but I am not certain whether I should direct it to the Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce or to the Minister of State for International Trade. Perhaps, when they both hear the question, the proper minister will respond.
It is reported that the New England Fisheries Management Council has recommended a possession limit for scallops which would permit only exports across the United States border from Canada of scallops weighing 40 meats to the pound. I therefore ask the responsible minister, since this is an obvious attempt to limit trade, has any action been taken by the United States to establish this type of non-tariff trade barrier; if so, what action does he plan to take to "assist"-I guess that is the best word-Canada's $60 million-plus scallop industry? Has he held any consultations with his counterpart in the United States State Department, and what will he do to help the Canadian fishermen retain their share of the U.S. market?

Madam Speaker, this question is the subject of consultation between Canadian officials and the fishermen involved. There were also contacts at the political level.
When the American trade ambassador, Mr. Brock, was here, both my colleague, the minister responsible for international trade, and myself did raise this question with the American delegation and pointed out very clearly that while we accepted conservation measures, conservation measures which would become trade barriers were not acceptable. This will be the subject of further discussion.


Madam Speaker, 1 have a supplementary question which I believe should go to the Secretary of State for External Affairs, but in his absence perhaps the Minister of Fisheries would also endeavour to answer.
In view of the fact that there are very few people in our foreign embassies with a background of Fisheries experience, I would ask if the government would give consideration to staffing more of our High Commissions in strategic Fish buying countries with fisheries experts, in the hope that they may assist in expanding markets for this particularly troubled industry which is presently facing serious marketing and economic problems?


Madam Speaker, I would like to inform the hon. member that during the past year we have made substantial efforts with respect to the export of fish products all around the world. As a matter of fact, if my memory serves me correctly, to the end of the First 11 months, up to November 30, our exports to the United States increased by approximately 23 per cent, and exports to other countries were up approximately 19 per cent, excluding the United States. We have undertaken a special program of up to $750,000 with respect to the export of mackerel from Newfoundland to Nigeria.
I also initiated two or three trade shows in the United States of America and we will have four or Five trade shows around the world during the next four or five months to try to promote Canadian fish products.


And not a single guaranteed sale.


Madam Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development. Since the minister's department has authorized a cutback in payments of $10 per month to registered Indians who live and attend schools off reserves as regional budgets are cut, and since lawyers in his department are now saying that the department never had the necessary authority to make the payments in the first place, would the minister clarify for the House why the cutbacks are taking place, and why this useful program is being cut back?


Madam Speaker, I would like to thank the hon. member for giving me notice of his question today through my department.
The department only has authority for the payment of allowances of this kind on-reserve. It is my information, and I am checking into it now as a result of the hon. member's inquiries, that these Indian students are off-reserve, as well as their parents.
The reason for this is the federal responsibility for Indians on-reserve. We want to utilize the moneys we have available for educational purposes to the maximum extent for Indians on reserve. We think that parents of Indians and Indian children who have moved off the reserve are paying taxes to the provinces, and the provinces should be prepared to afford them the same educational opportunities they do every other resident in the provinces. As you know, the federal government does share significantly in the educational expenses of the provinces. That has been acceptable to many provinces.
At any rate, the short answer is that we just do not have the authority for payment off-reserve.


Madam Speaker, since department policies and department economic development policies in general have helped encourage Indians to leave the reserve, and since the education of Indians is generally a federal responsibility, as I understand it, and since these Indian students have enough difficulty in completing their high school education as a result of being faced with social, cultural and economic pressures, will the minister undertake to obtain the necessary authority to continue the program that was carried out so that these students will again be encouraged to work toward the completion of their high school education? Only a very few ever make it through high school as it is.


It will not cost you much.


Madam Speaker, I cannot agree with the premise of the hon. member that the policies we are designing are encouraging Indians to leave the reserve. It is quite the opposite. In the last two years, since I have been minister of this department, we have doubled the total expenditures on Indian housing throughout Canada, and I would anticipate that next year we may even triple it in an all-out attack on the question of inadequate housing for Indians.
I would also indicate that in the last budget native economic development was one of the two prime concerns listed for
February 4, 1982

massive expenditures by this government, to the tune of $346 million starting next year. This is to encourage Indians to maintain their culture, to allow them to make their reserves economically viable so they will not have to leave them. Certainly with these breakthroughs, Madam Speaker, I would indicate to the hon. member that yes, this should free up additional moneys to afford even greater initiatives in the educational sphere for the Indian people.


Madam Speaker, my question is supplementary to the answer given by the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans to the hon. member for Vancouver South.
If Mr. Kirby is considering representation from a big organization on the east coast, what about the representatives of the large inshore fishery being on that task force as advisers? I would suggest that perhaps this would be an advisory committee which would be set up with the Five Atlantic provinces involved. If there is representation from a big organization, I suggest that there has to be someone there from the inshore fishery.


Madam Speaker, perhaps the hon. member did not understand, or hear-


Oh, oh!


It is sometimes difficult.


The Leader of the Opposition should listen
occasionally.


If 1 can find someone worth listening to.


Maybe you are not quite clear enough.


Maybe I did not express myself clearly enough. I did make the point very simply that Mr. Nicholson was not there as a representative of a large organization. In fact he resigned in order to work for the task force. I said very clearly that Mr. Kirby had made some efforts to enlist the participation of representatives of the fishermen. I think the hon. member's idea of an advisory committee is a perfectly valid one.


Madam Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Transport. Is the minister aware of the story on the wire services attributed to
Business of the House
Mr. Lawless, President of CN Rail, who has just confirmed that 1,800 railway jobs will be terminated, which will have a disastrous effect generally throughout the CN Railway, but in particular the Atlantic area where it will hit very hard? If he is not aware of it, will he study it and, if he is aware of it, what does he intend to do?


Madam Speaker, indeed I am not pleased about it at all. I am aware of these reductions in employment. This is due, of course, to a reduction in traffic which was 8 per cent in the second half of last year compared to the First half.
In making his announcement today, Mr. Lawless made the observation that because of early retirement and relocation benefits the number of people affected will be significantly less than the number of positions being abolished.


It is still 1,800 people out of work.


This should be borne in mind. Another point Mr. Lawless makes is that these people are entitled to supplemental employment benefits which amount to 80 per cent of their salaries. This is not by way of compensation for the jobs which will be lost, but these are two important qualifying factors in the announcement.


Madam Speaker, I am glad that the minister is aware of the story. I would like to point out two other factors which I hope he would discuss with Mr. Lawless, to see if he could rationalize how a Crown corporation, at a time when all Canadians are experiencing dire straits in one form or another-the loss of a job or job opportunity is about as dire as you can get-how a Crown corporation can eliminate jobs, and announce in the same story a profit of $180 million for the year. At the same time, its competitor, CP, which is experiencing the same economic decline as is affecting this country, is not laying off one person.


Madam Speaker, I do not know all of the comparative details between CP and CN on that subject. CN obviously is not in the business of losing money. It is not in the business of declaring a deficit every year. This Parliament has asked CN to be run in an efficient manner, so it occasionally declares a profit. If it followed the principles implied in the hon. member's question, it would not be in a position to do that.


Madam Speaker, might I ask the government House leader the usual Thursday question relating to the

February 4, 1982
Business of the House
business for tomorrow and for as much of next week as he is able to indicate.
While he is dealing with that, would he give me some indication when Bill C-60 will receive royal proclamation? The minister will recall that bill deals with further protection for farmers and other land holders in the west over whose property the Alaska gas pipeline will be routed. Is proclamation of that bill awaiting the disposition of Bill C-87, which is the legislation to expand the membership of the NEB?


Madam Speaker, on the last question, I will look into the matter and try to report to my colleague as early as possible.
In so far as the business of the House is concerned, tomorrow the first items of business will be some motions to concur in Notices of Ways and Means Motions regarding borrowing authority, excise tax amendments and petroleum and gas revenue tax amendments. All these relate to budget measures. We all know that those motions to concur are not debatable, and they will be brought in on orders of the day tomorrow. Following that we will continue debate at the second reading stage of the Canagrex bill, Bill C-85. We certainly hope that bill can be read the second time by the end of the day tomorrow.

Regarding the business of the House for next week, Madam Speaker, I would say that provided we have finished second reading of the bill to promote exports of Canadian agricultural and food products tomorrow, on Monday we can start considering Bill C-89, an act to amend the National Housing Act, which is also a budgetary measure. Tuesday and Wednesday we should be able to consider the borrowing authority bill which includes the other budgetary measures I mentioned earlier and which are all connected with a bill that is likely to be tabled Monday. On Thursday we shall resume debate on Bill C-89, an act to amend the National Housing Act, and next Friday is hereby designated as an opposition day. That is more or less the agenda we can look forward to next week.


Can the government House leader give us any indication whatsoever when the ways and means motion with respect to amending the Income Tax Act will be brought in?


Unless I am mistaken, Notice of Motion No. 40 is already on the Order Paper, and concerns a Notice of Ways and Means Motion to amend the Income Tax Act. It is appended to the Votes and Proceedings
