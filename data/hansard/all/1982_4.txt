Madam Speaker, I rise to move a motion under the provisions of Standing Order 43. One thousand and twenty-five women and 247 men who make up the staff of MPs and Senators are to become the latest victims of the government's unjust society. The government amendment introduced last Friday to the wage restraint legislation, Bill C-124, treats staff members, who have no security or tenure, more harshly than it treats public servants or even members of this House. Therefore I move, seconded by all members of the official opposition:
That the government immediately amend the legislation before us in Bill C-124 so that its provisions take effect for the staffs of MPs and Senators on the expiry of their present salary arrangements as they will for all employees in the public service, and that the staffs of MPs and Senators not be singled out for punitive action by the government.


Is there unanimous consent for this motion?


Agreed.


No.


Madam Speaker, I rise to move a motion under the provisions of Standing Order 43. Granville Island Market is operated in trust for CMHC. Since July 1 the merchants are operating without leases because CMHC has multiplied the rents by 100 per cent and 200 per cent on one-year lease renewals with no options to renew. Therefore I move, seconded by the hon. member for Capilano (Mr. Huntington):
That this House demand of the minister responsible for CMHC that he remove the climate of instability within the business community of Granville Island and that his corporation live within the 6 and 5 guideline his government is imposing on others.


Is there unanimous consent for this motion?


Agreed.


No.


Madam Speaker, I rise to move a motion under the provisions of Standing Order 43. Canadians are finally realizing that the Prime Minister (Mr. Trudeau) is galloping us down the slippery slope to complete socialism. The energy minister for the British government, Mr. Nigel Lawson, is quoted as saying that this fall or winter when that government sells off its state-owned oil company to the private sector, "It will be the biggest new issue that the London Stock Exchange has ever seen." The British government will sell 51 per cent to the public. Hurrah for the mother of democracy!
At a time when other governments-Britain and the U.S. are notable examples-are selling off state enterprises, Socialist Liberal Canada is adding to the total of more money-losing Crown corporations. Whereas privatization means more competition, lower prices to the consumer, badly needed injections of cash for government, a smaller bureaucracy, and a larger stake for Canadians in their country, I move, seconded by the hon. member for Bow River (Mr. Taylor):
That the government immediately embrace sunset laws and make the average Canadian a true partner by stock offerings in various of the 480 Crown agencies. Petro-Canada would be a significant first step in tipping the balance back to the private sector. If it's ours, make it ours.


Is there unanimous consent for this motion?


Agreed.

August 2, 1982


Madam Speaker, my motion arises out of the fact the recession has hit Canada harder than most other industrialized nations. Underlying this, and the inability of the Canadian government to respond properly to this economic crisis, is the fact that we have a degree of foreign ownership in Canada which is higher than any other industrialized nation would permit. Therefore, under the provisions of Standing Order 43, I move, seconded by the hon. member for Brant (Mr. Blackburn):
That in order that the Canadian government has the means to protect and nurture our nation's economy, measures be taken to strengthen the Foreign Investment Review Act rather than weaken it, as has been proposed in the June budget.


Is there unanimous consent for this motion?


Agreed.


No.


Madam Speaker, the Prime Minister's (Mr. Trudeau) heavy-handed threat to provincial governments and businesses dealing with the federal government to toe the 6-5 benchmark, or else, is pure and simple blackmail and, in effect, constitutes back door, extralegal extensions of his austerity program. Many Canadian businesses have gone under; others have cut management and workers' salaries. But favourites of the government in a Liberal stronghold are not required to trim fat. Favourite son treatment and preferential loans are assured. Therefore, under the provisions of Standing Order 43, I move, seconded by the hon. member for Cambridge (Mr. Speyer):
That if the government is serious about the 6 per cent society it hopes to create, it review and slash its own runaway spending and cease its huge payouts to Liberal Party golden-haired businesses.


Is there unanimous consent for this motion?


Agreed.


No.


Madam Speaker, Canada's push toward metric has been unnecessary and costly for farmers, as well as exceedingly frustrating. Now it is resulting in expensive crop losses and possible environmental hazards because of major mistakes in chemical formulations given in the new metric books and pamphlets. For example, a loss of 200 acres of dead alfalfa was reported in the weekend news. Under imperial measures farmers could spot such errors which often are typographical, but the strange metric language makes this almost impossible. Therefore I move, seconded by the hon. member for Malpeque (Mr. Gass):
That manufacturers and processors be permitted to include imperial as well as metric measurements and instructions on their product labels and books.


Is there unanimous consent for this motion?


Agreed.


No.


Madam Speaker, for several years Canadians have pointed with pride to their high technology industry. To be told now that the industry could suffer permanent damage because of a shortage of highly-skilled people in our domestic supply is simply inexcusable. Therefore I move, seconded by the hon. member for Simcoe North (Mr. Lewis):
That the Minister of Employment and Immigration launch a massive national training program to match people with jobs, using innovative training and retraining methods so that this only growth industry in our country need not apply for offshore help.


Is there unanimous consent for this motion?


Agreed.


No.


Madam Speaker, I rise under the provisions of Standing Order 43 on a matter of urgent and pressing necessity. In view of the fact that the
August 2, 1982

residents of East Burnaby are very strongly opposed to the building of the proposed Stormont-Newcombe Freeway connector, which would cause serious disruption to a quiet residential neighbourhood, and in view of the fact that the Stormont-Newcombe connector can only be built through federal land on the George Derby Hospital property with the consent of the Minister of Public Works (Mr. Cosgrove), I move, seconded by the hon. member for Comox-Powell River (Mr. Skelly):
That this House, while agreeing that surplus federal lands should be returned to the municipality of Burnaby, strongly urge the federal Minister of Public Works to oppose any plan for development of the George Derby lands which would permit the construction of the Stormont-Newcombe exchange through East Burnaby.


Is there unanimous consent for this motion?


Agreed.


No.


Madam Speaker, scientific studies have shown that, as unemployment rises, we can expect an increase in prison admissions and physical and mental health problems in Canada. Therefore I move, seconded by the hon. member for Surrey-White Rock-North Delta (Mr. Friesen):
That this House ask the Minister of National Health and Welfare to provide the Standing Committee on Health, Welfare and Social Affairs with the necessary reference to allow it to inquire and report to Paliament on appropriate measures for the identification, prevention and treatment of such persons undergoing physical and mental problems related to unemployment.


Is there unanimous consent for this motion?


Agreed.


No.


Madam Speaker, since in report stage debate Friday on Bill C-124 the government introduced an amendment rolling back wage increases already granted to employees of Members of Parliament and Senators, since this amendment would treat these low-paid workers differently from other groups of workers affected by the bill, and since it is called the "Baker" amendment by Liberal members of the House in honour of the hon. member for
Nepean-Carleton (Mr. Baker), and the "Johnston" amendment by the Conservatives in honour of the President of the Treasury Board (Mr. Johnston), 1 move, seconded by the hon. member for Kootenay East-Revelstoke (Mr. Parker):
That the House give these hon. members the opportunity to denounce their unwanted offspring and allow them, with unanimous consent, to introduce a Johnston-Baker amendment to allow affected employees the right to retain the salaries already granted.


Is there unanimous consent for this motion?


Agreed.


No.


Madam Speaker, whereas the excise tax increases the cost of production of foods produced on farms, and the price becomes more and more inflationary as the said foods move from farms to consumers, I move, seconded by the hon. member for Edmonton North (Mr. Paproski):
That this House implores the government to recognize the damage this aspect of the national energy policy is doing to this country and rescind the said tax at once. This would be a splendid start if the government really wants to reduce inflation.


Is there unanimous consent for this motion?


Agreed.


No.


Madam Speaker, whereas the first Monday in August is a holiday celebrated by most employees in the country, and whereas the employees of the House of Commons would have received a holiday for the first Monday in August had the House not sat today, I move, seconded by the hon. member for Burnaby (Mr. Robinson):
That this House ask that the employees of the House of Commons be given a day off to be selected by mutual agreement to replace the day lost today.


is there unanimous consent for this motion?


Agreed.

19896_______________________________COMMONS DEBATES
Oral Questions
August 2, 1982


Madam Speaker, my question is directed to the Prime Minister. In view of the announcement late Friday afternoon, in almost a furtive way, that Maislin trucking was going to be bailed out by the government to the tune of a $34 million loan guarantee, I would ask the Prime Minister, as the leader of this land who is trying to get Canadians to go on a crusade of frugality, and who is trying to show restraint in government spending, does this type of government action not make a complete mockery of the government's present attempts at restraint when the government is, in effect, bailing out a near bankrupt company.


Madam Speaker, I suppose that that is a question of judgment and the hon. member has already expressed his views, as did another member of his party, on Friday, I believe. But in the view of this government, since this company had plans for recovery which were judged to be acceptable and plausible by the banks and the government, it was important to try to give them assistance. It is always a difficult judgment in cases like this. I noticed to my recollection, that the Tory party did not criticize when we guaranteed Chrysler, when it was near bankruptcy, and that appears to have been a fairly good gamble. They did not criticize when we supported Massey-Ferguson. I am just a bit puzzled why they criticize when we give assistance to Maislin.


Perhaps to help educate the Prime Minister, if one could, on why there is some concern about this extraordinary assistance to the Maislin Company, the two examples the Prime Minister named were two that are presently covered under the ILAP program of assistance to the manufacturing and processing industries. This is assistance in a brand new field, to a service industry.


Madam Speaker, my supplementary question is again to the Prime Minister. To show leadership, it is now to be taken by any other business concern in this country, especially the service industries which are just keeping their heads above water, that it is perhaps better for them to go under water and apply for assistance than to make rigorous judgments and sacrifices that the Prime Minister is asking for, or should they come to Ottawa to see some of their political friends to get assistance? That is the reason for the concern here.
What incentives are there for the managers in other service industries across this country to try to sacrifice and show restraint, when this company, because of poor management,
taking over an American concern and going into debt many millions of dollars, is able to be bailed out?


Madam Speaker, the House knows that in the budgets of June and November, there were forms of assistance to smaller enterprises in difficulty. That was the definition which applied- when small businesses were in difficulty they could apply for the bond for special assistance under the budget. As I replied in my first answer, we also look at larger enterprises, particularly when they are key to a whole region and when there are many jobs to be saved. We not only try to assist the small and medium-sized enterprises, we also look at the larger enterprises, as in the case of Chrysler, Massey-Ferguson and Maislin.


Madam Speaker, I am a little hesitant to ask my supplementary question, but I will ask it very directly of the Prime Minister. Is the Prime Minister really trying to fool anybody, that if it had not been for Charles Bronfman and other political leaders close to the Prime Minister in Montreal, Maislin would not have received help?


Madam Speaker, I think the question itself is unfair. 1 can assure the hon. member that-


What about the All-Star game in Montreal?


-in so far as I know, Mr. Bronfman has made no representations, nor have his associates, to members of this government. They certainly have made no representations to me with regard to Maislin. I do not know why the hon. member is giving them credit for that.


What about the All-Star game in Montreal?


Well, I would like to hear the supplementary about the All-Star game. I am not sure about its relevancy, but let us hear the question if the hon. member does not want to deal only in innuendoes.


The hon. member for Prince Edward-Hastings.


Well, if Madam Speaker will allow me, I will put the question. Were you and Mr. Bronfman together at the All-Star game in Montreal when this matter was discussed?


Order. The hon. member for Prince Edward-Hastings.


Madam Speaker-


I did not hear the question.
August 2, 1982


If you will allow the question, I will try to
answer.


The hon. member for Prince Edward-Hastings.


Madam Speaker, my question is directed to the Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce. On Friday last, in answer to a direct question from me with regard to Maislin Industries, the minister stated that no decision had been made at that point. The minister said, "When matters are at a final and definitive stage, I will be happy to make an announcement." Will the minister now tell the House what developments took place between noon and five o'clock on Friday to make him happy before the announcement was made?


Madam Speaker, late in the afternoon, shortly before my announcement, there was an acceptance of the conditional offer referred to in my press release, and that led to my decision to make the announcement.


Madam Speaker, my supplementary question is directed to the same minister. In the past Maislin Industries have not been particularly good corporate citizens in that they tend to purchase as much of their equipment as possible outside Canada.


Like Petro-Canada.


Does the agreement for the loan guarantee carry with it any strings requiring Maislin to buy Canadian, or is that ignored also, just as the fact that the majority of the guaranteed $34 million will end up in the United States is also ignored?


Madam Speaker, I do not accept the hon. member's premise. It is my understanding that the loans to be guaranteed by the government will be loans made by the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce. With respect to the matter of purchasing and sourcing, these are areas which we are still exploring with the company. But I can say there is one matter of Canadian sourcing and Canadian supply which my hon. friend has completely forgotten to mention, and that is the supply of
2,000	Canadian jobs. He does not think it is important. We do.


Hear, hear!
Oral Questions ENERGY


Madam Speaker, my question is directed to the Minister of Finance. The minister will probably recall that on Tuesday last, in a statement issued by the Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources with regard to Suncor, it was stated that the company has also committed itself to supporting federal wage guidelines of 6 per cent and 5 per cent and-this is the part with which I want to deal-will limit increases of prices not subject to the energy agreement with Alberta to levels that are consistent with the lower rates of interest and costs and restoration of historical profit margins.
On the weekend, Leonard Good, the director general in the federal Department of Energy, Mines and Resources, said that he simply did not know the implications of this statement in terms of its legality or monitoring, or in deciding the definition of "historical profit margins." Since it is the Minister of Finance who will have to decide what historical profit margins are, and given that this is the first in a whole series of what I suspect will be attempts by companies to restore what they consider to be historical profit margins, what is the definition that the government intends to apply to the term "historical profit margins?"


Madam Speaker, 1 have not seen the quote that is attributed to Mr. Good in terms of the commitment given by Suncor. It has been spelled out in a press release and, as my hon. friend has indicated, the government will follow the evolution of prices. We have not introduced a system of price controls any more than we have instituted a system of wage controls of a general nature. We have asked for the voluntary co-operation of industry, of the private sector and of the unions.
In this particular instance, the company has volunteered to adhere to the wage guidelines which the government has imposed upon itself. It has also volunteered to keep its price increases to a minimum level, bearing in mind the factors to which the hon. member has referred. We are operating on the basis of a voluntary commitment system. We will examine how the company behaves as time goes on, under this voluntary commitment. I remind the hon. member that the government has not introduced a system of wage and price controls in the Canadian economy.


Madam Speaker, I put to the minister that it says quite clearly the company has committed itself that it will limit increases in prices, those

August 2, 1982
Oral Questions
outside the energy agreement, to something it calls the "restoration of historical profit margins." In order to get the assistance from the government, the company obviously felt it had to make a commitment. What will the government use as its benchmark to establish historical profit margins? Would the minister consider the six-year average 1976 to 1981? Would that be a suitable benchmark for historical profit margins?


Madam Speaker, this is a matter that will be examined as the situation evolves. This is a voluntary commitment given by the company in exchange for a special contribution for the realization of a very important project that will generate several thousand jobs in Ontario and throughout Canada. We are going to work on this basis through the cooperation of the industry and, I hope, the unions. This is the way the program is going to be implemented.


Madam Speaker, it is quite clear that the senior officials in the minister's own department do not know how to deal with that particular phrase. The government is not prepared to accept voluntary restraint for its employees or, for that matter, employees of Members of Parliament. The company believes it has made a commitment. Given the six-year average from 1976 to 1981 for profits in refining and marketing, those areas that fall outside the energy agreement, the average was $51 million per year. In 1980 and 1981 the average was more than twice that amount. Is the government prepared to demand from Suncor that it go back to the five or six-year average of $51 million from the $100 million to $115 million that it received in 1980 and 1981?


Madam Speaker, I can tell the hon. member that the government will not rely on a single year to establish such a reference. Second, we certainly would not use the highest year, which was 1981, as a reference point. One would have to look at an extended period of time. This matter is going to be examined and discussed with the company.


Madam Speaker, my question is directed to the President of the Treasury Board. It is prompted by the loan guarantee to the Maislin Trucking Company and the condition of the 6-5 regime. A week ago in this House we passed the Small Businesses Loans Act. The minister is aware that that gives a preferential rate of interest, and this government or any other government guarantees the loans to qualified small-business men. In light of the Maislin precedent, does the minister envisage that when the bank
allows a loan under the Small Businesses Loans Act which the government guarantees, the 6-5 regime will apply there? Will it also apply to the small business development bond and to the 4 per cent subsidy? Does the minister envisage that as a result of the criteria?


Madam Speaker, it is not apparent in what capacity the hon. member for Cambridge addresses this question to me as President of the Treasury Board. Neither of the issues to which he makes reference come within the jurisdiction of the Board. Perhaps he might care to address a supplementary to some other minister.


Madam Speaker, my supplementary question is directed to the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister has said that he wants businessmen and others in the country who receive grants or government assistance to abide by the 6-5 guidelines. A week ago last Friday we passed in this House a bill respecting the Small Businesses Loans Act whereby there is a guarantee by this government to pay the banks in the event of default by small-business men who receive loans. Does the Prime Minister envisage that the 6-5 guidelines will apply to small businesses in circumstances under which loans made by banks are guaranteed by the government?


Madam Speaker, I am not aware of the substance of the question, but I would be happy to consider the hon. member's question as a representation and look into it.


Madam Speaker, I have a supplementary question for the Minister of Finance. By guaranteeing a loan to Maislin the government assumes a contingent liability. In relation to any Crown corporation or private company for which the government carries a contingent liability on its books, is it the policy of the government that the 6-5 guidelines apply to the beneficiary of that contingent liability? The question is as simple as that.


Madam Speaker, if there are additional cases similar to Maislin, obviously it will be the intention of the government to seek similar assurance with respect to the 65 guidelines. The hon. member has asked a question about a law passed by Parliament establishing the conditions under which certain funds are available to small businesses. If hon. members are suggesting that in those cases we ought to add another condition that the 6-5 be applied, that is something to which I would give consideration. I would do so, however, somewhat hesitantly.
August 2, 1982


Madam Speaker, then is it the policy of the government that any existing contingent liability prior to the budget is not affected by the 6-5 guidelines? Hon. members are not asking for anything. We are trying to find out whether the 6-5 guidelines are to be made applicable to a private or public group or corporation which benefits by virtue of any contingent liability assumed by the government once the government assumes the contingent liability. I believe the minister can answer that because he is being prompted by the Prime Minister.


Madam Speaker, the answer I gave earlier is the precise answer I want to give to the second question, because it covers the whole matter fully.


You don't know. You don't have a policy.


Madam Speaker, my question is directed to the Minister of National Defence. On Friday last the CBC questioned the minister concerning the projected move of the headquarters of the naval reserves from Halifax to Quebec City. The minister replied at that time that, if the move was decided upon, he would make an announcement at the appropriate time and place. There are many parliamentarians who believe that the appropriate place for ministers to make announcements on policy is in the House of Commons. Will the minister be making a statement on motions today on this subject?


Madame Speaker, as far as I am concerned, I do not think that is the proper way.


Oh, oh!

Madam Speaker, the former minister of national defence knows perfectly well that achieving fair and equitable francophone participation in the Canadian Navy is an issue that has been discussed for a number of years in navy circles. The civilian officials of my department asked me about this when I became Minister of National Defence in 1980, and at that time 1 asked the department's military authorities to make a study of the matter and make appropriate recommendations on how to achieve a fairer and more equitable participation of francophones in the Navy. They approached the issue in various ways and made a number of suggestions, and I think it
Oral Questions
is now an administrative decision that is up to the Department of National Defence and the Commander of the Canadian Maritime Force. Once they have decided what is to be done, we shall make a joint announcement at the appropriate time.


Madam Speaker, the minister knows that studies were undertaken and recommendations recently made offering him six different courses. In evidence given to the Standing Committee on External Affairs and National Defence the president of the Naval Officers Association recommended-and officers of the minister's own staff have recommended-that an additional two units be placed in the province of Quebec. This would require six regular personnel per unit, and new jobs would be created. Is the truth of the matter that the existing 60 jobs to be moved from Halifax to Quebec City are the real reason the minister is going through with this move, which will lead to nothing but inefficiency in the naval service?


Madam Speaker, this question has been addressed by my department at the administrative level. My department has a solution. It has been proposed to me, I have accepted it, and they have decided to make the announcement of these-


"They" have? You are the minister.


I am the minister, but I do not play politics with defence.


Oh, oh!


Madam Speaker, my question is directed to the Minister of State for International Trade. Several weeks ago the minister indicated that he had eased entry of Japanese auto imports into the country as a gesture of good will toward the Japanese in trade negotiations. I wonder if the minister could inform the House as to the development of these negotiations or any positive things which may have occurred since this gesture of good will.


Madam Speaker, I know how interested the hon. member and other hon. members are regarding a solution to the problem with respect to Japan and the car issue. Our officials left for Tokyo during the weekend, and it is hoped that within a week we will be able to resolve this issue.

August 2, 1982
Oral Questions


Madam Speaker, my question is directed to the President of the Treasury Board. On Friday last the minister gave notice that he intends actually to cut the pay of staffs of Members of Parliament and senators, 80 per cent of whom are women. These staffs are denied free collective bargaining rights and, in many instances, are certainly not overpaid. In view of the fact that this sleazy, shameful move, which constitutes nothing less than playing cheap politics on the backs of hard-working parliamentary staff members, puts this group of employees in a worse position than any other employees in the country, including Members of Parliament and senators, will the minister explain this shameful betrayal of our employees, and will be reconsider this shabby scapegoating amendment?


Madam Speaker, I think the accusation is somewhat exaggerated. If I may take a moment, let me explain why this amendment was judged to be necessary. Hon. members may recall that the hon. member for Nepean-Carleton, supported by the hon. member for Perth and the hon. member for Peterborough, accused the government of treating ministerial exempt staff with undue favour by providing a 10 per cent raise which was decided May 13. When I look at Hansard, I see that the hon. member for Nepean-Carleton said on July 5:
-why does he-
He was referring to me.
-not do the honourable thing and roll them all back so that the exempt staff will stand in exactly the same position as public servants?
In fact, exempt staff did stand in exactly the same position as public servants, but to a degree the hon. member for Nepean-Carleton apparently was successful in misleading the country and independent observers into thinking some favouritism had been granted.
It is absolutely fundamental to the credibility of this program that the government be perceived as dealing harshly with Members of Parliament, with itself, and with others. Thanks to the efforts of the opposition, that has become virtually impossible in the present circumstances, and hence it is with some regret-but, nevertheless, judged to be necessary-that we put all political appointees, in keeping with the request of the hon. member for Nepean-Carleton, on the same footing.


Madam Speaker, my supplementary question is directed to the same minister. The minister has broken the solemn promise he made to this House on July 9 when he said there would be no reductions in wages and salaries for anyone other than Members of Parliament and senators. The minister stated, in reply to representations made by the hon. member for Nepean-Carleton, that he would not make ministerial staffs, as he put it, "particular sacrificial lambs." How can the minister stand before us with any sense of equity or fairness and say he intends to make this particular
group of employees the victims of his game of political one-upmanship with the Conservative Party? Will the minister now stop trying to score cheap political points on the backs of the staffs of Members of Parliament and senators?


Madam Speaker, we are not talking about political points. We are talking about a national assault on inflation, with the federal government taking the lead.
Because of accusations that have been made which, on their face and on the facts, are false, a number of observers such as the Ottawa Citizen last week, a respected newspaper in this country, wrote that:
Another example of its bankruptcy-
Speaking of the government-
-came when Liberal MPs defeated a Tory effort to have cabinet aides' salaries cut back to the 6 per cent guideline, along with public servants.
Clearly, even the editorial staff of the Ottawa Citizen was misled by the statements coming from the member for Nepean-Carleton. Not only that, they refer to 11 per cent, but the next day, I should point out, there was an apology in the newspaper pointing out that the figure was 10 per cent. So there is no effort here at all to take advantage or to score cheap political points.
What is important is that the government be perceived as taking the lead and that it not be accused falsely by members of the opposition. It is with regret that I introduced this amendment, but in the circumstances it is clearly necessary if the public has the impression that political appointees were enjoying some special benefit.


Madam Speaker, if there is an assault on anything it is on honesty. That is the first assault. The second is on the staff of Members of Parliament who work in this House.
The government has never taken my advice on anything in the ten years I have been here, and it has not taken it now. I want to ask the minister what highly paid, politically appointed member of his exempt staff advised such a stupid, harsh, vindictive move as the government just put forward in its amendment in this House?


Madam Speaker, I mark the unctuous tones in which the hon. member addresses this issue. As my parliamentary secretary indicated last week, the hon. member is the spiritual father of this whole affair. Let me quote the hon. member for Nepean-Carleton as reported at page 18984 of Hansard as follows:
-why does the President of the Treasury Board not do the honourable thing? Rather than defending the indefensible increases for political staff, the appointees of himself and his colleagues, why does he not do the honourable thing and
August 2, 1982

roll them all back so that the exempt staff will stand in exactly the same position as public servants?
He asked for an amendment to roll back the salaries of exempt staff. He proposed an amendment before committee to roll back salaries of exempt staff. The exempt staff of ministers stand on exactly the same footing as all political appointees-


That is another falsehood.


-of parliamentarians in this House and in the Senate, and in the office of the Leader of the Opposition and in the caucus bureaus. If we are to play the hair-shirt role, Madam Speaker, I suggest we all play it, and that the hon. member stop speaking out of both sides of his mouth.


Hear, hear!


Oh, oh!


Madam Speaker, the hon. member knows that the exempt staff is not the same as the staff in the House of Commons.


Hear, hear!


They have higher salaries and the protection of an entree into the Public Service of Canada. In other words, they are different. More than that, they are just the pets of the government and it wanted to protect them when it was found with its hand in the cookie jar.
If the minister is going to accept my advice, will he accept this piece of advice, that is, resign, and let them put someone competent in his position?
Hon. Donald. J. Johnston (President of the Treasury
Board): Madam Speaker, I take it that the hon. member for Nepean-Carleton is asking me to follow his example when he resigned as House leader. I have no intention of resigning, the Prime Minister and God willing!


Oh, oh!


One has not been introduced to the other.


I feel that in the circumstances we have done the logical if not, perhaps, unfortunate thing in the circumstances. These circumstances have been created by the kind of argument just put forward by the hon. member for Nepean-Carleton. Now, all of a sudden, exempt staff are different in some way from parliamentary staff.


Right on.


Is a secretary working in a minister's office who is on an exempt staff budget different from a secretary working at the next desk on a parliamentary budget? I would ask the hon. member to explain that conundrum to the House.
Oral Questions AGRICULTURE


Madam Speaker, my question is also directed to the President of the Treasury Board. As the 1200 per cent increase in the charge for table stock potato inspection for export was implemented on July 19, and as the minister announced that any increases higher than 6 per cent which were not implemented before June 28 would be rolled back, would he advise the House if this 1200 per cent increase will be rolled back to 6 per cent?


Madam Speaker, finally we have a sensible and reasonable question.


Oh, oh!


A directive was issued by Treasury Board to all ministers withdrawing the delegated authority to assign any kind of increase for goods and services to the government in excess of 6 per cent. I have not looked at the specific details. The hon. member was kind enough to give me notice of this question. It would seem to me on its face that this is one of the increases that should be rolled back.


Madam Speaker, the Atlantic Provinces Transportation Commission has inquired of CN Rail if the 6 per cent maximum guideline will apply to rail freight traffic. CN Rail responded by advising that, since it had not received any specific directives from the federal government, it would continue to price its rail services to reflect normal market factors while attempting to recover, as much as it can, the cost increases due to inflation.
Could the minister advise the House whether directives will be issued to CN Rail to limit their price increase to 6 per cent, and also will a directive be issued to CN Marine which is in charge of the ferries between P.E.I. and New Brunswick advising that a 6 per cent increase is the maximum?


Madam Speaker, each situation is a special one. The role of the CTC is different with respect to air fares, and with respect to rail rates, for example. The present attitude is to look at each of those in particular and decide on the basis of special circumstances, if any.

Oral Questions SUPPLY AND SERVICES


Madam Speaker, my question is directed to the Minister of Supply and Services. A contract is being put out for bids for the maintenance of the CF-404 engine for the new F-18 aircraft. The word in the marketplace is that Air Canada and CP Air are to be allowed to bid for the maintenance of these engines. Is that true and, if so, why are they being allowed to bid on this contract?


Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. gentleman for the question. The matter is under serious consideration. There has been a request both by Air Canada and CP Air that they be permitted to offer their facilities to provide repair and overhaul for the CF-404 engine. My department is very interested in seeking the best possible return for taxpayers' dollars. We are considering very seriously whether Air Canada and CP Air would be permitted to bid on the contract.


Madam Speaker, what kind of assurances can the minister give Orenda Engines and Rolls-Royce, the two companies that have been overhauling and keeping these engines up to date for the armed forces over the years? What kind of assurances can he give them that the competition will be fair, because of the facilities that Air Canada and CP Air have at the present time?


Madam Speaker, when the offer was made by Air Canada and by CP Air to participate in the bidding, one of the major considerations, of course, was fairness. That is still one of the major considerations. My officials have been directed to analyse what the bidding criteria will be in order to ensure that there is absolute fairness in the bidding process for all participants and in the eventual selection of a successful bidder.


Madam Speaker, I have a question that relates to the fairness of the bidding process and it is directed to the Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources. It concerns the awarding of drilling permits off Sable Island to Petro-Canada and others, with no competitive bidding being allowed. The minister has said:
It was quite clear in our view that no one else could have come forward with a better bid.
Would the minister be prepared to publish the evidence which allowed him to deny other companies the right to bid on this matter?


Madam Speaker, I would like to refer the Right Hon. Leader of the Opposition to the fact that we had the full support and agreement of the Government of Nova Scotia in this particular decision.
This decision means a $500 million investment in offshore drilling by Canadian oil and gas companies which include not only Petro-Canada but Husky Oil and Bow Valley. This deal means the companies concerned will spend that money in the space of the next three years, and that at the end of the second year the companies will relinquish 75 per cent of the lands they prefer not to keep to the government. In addition, the companies gave extremely strong commitments to Canadian content for goods and services. It was quite clear, in our judgment, that no other bid could come near to this.


How do you know?


As far as the reference is concerned about which the Right Hon. Leader of the Opposition is asking, I would be pleased to send him a copy of the Canada Oil and Gas Act which includes the option for the minister to issue licences to competitors or bidders directly. I would also be pleased to send him a copy of the agreement which clearly indicates that this is an exceptionally good deal for the people of Nova Scotia and for the people of Canada, as has been stated by the Premier of Nova Scotia.


Madam Speaker, the minister has declined to publish his reasons for refusing competitive bidding. We are aware of the act. What we were not aware of was that the minister was going to abuse it so quickly.


Madam Speaker, it is now the policy of the government that drilling permits will be issued without competitive bidding, or is this case involving Petro-Canada a special one?


Madam Speaker, I have not refused to give the reasons. I said to the hon. member that he should read the act which was passed by this Parliament. It states quite specifically that there are two options open to the government.


He knows the act. Answer the question.


One is through bids and the other is through direct issuance. My intention is to follow generally the practice of open bidding except in rare circumstances.
As far as the reasons for this particular case are concerned, I again would invite the right hon. member to read the agreement reached by the government with the companies and I

think he will, as did the Premier of Nova Scotia, conclude that indeed this was a very, very good deal for Canada.


Madam Speaker, one of the conditions accepted by the consortium is to spend $1 million to study the feasibility of building a marine supply base somewhere in Nova Scotia. Will the minister tell us whether one of the locations being considered is in the constituency of the Minister of Finance?


1 hope so.
Hon. Marc Lalonde (Minister of Energy, Mines and
Resources): Madam Speaker, certainly one of the sites being used is Mulgrave where, as a matter of fact, Petro-Canada is going to have its supply base to start. The consortium, and Petro-Canada in particular, is going to carry out the study over the next year, and a decision will be announced in due time.


Madam Speaker, this deal smells, and it deserves to be investigated by a committee of the Parliament of this country. Would the minister allow, in the interest of all of the facts being known, an all-party committee of this House to investigate all aspects of the issuance of these permits without bids, including allowing the committee to examine, in confidence if necessary, all oral and all written undertakings between the government and representatives of the consortium? Will the minister let Parliament look into this deal?


Madam Speaker, Mulgrave is the site that was chosen by Petro-Canada on its own.


Oh, oh!


It happens to be the site closest to the drilling site. This decision has been made by Petro-Canada on its own.


If you believe that, I have some land in Florida for you.


I might tell the hon. member that, if he finds that this deal smells, the Leader of the Opposition stinks.


Shame!


You have risen to new lows.


Madam Speaker, my question is addressed to the Minister of Indians Affairs and
Oral Questions
Northern Development. Last Friday the minister hand delivered a fatal blow to Polar Bear Pass, one of the 140 ecological sites north of 60 that have been identified by the United Nations International Environmental Program. That fatal blow was the government's decision to allow oil and gas exploration in this sensitive ecological area. Since the minister has clearly not paid attention to the government's own environmental advisory council report on the threat to wildlife in the north from oil and gas exploration, will he take immediate steps to declare Polar Bear Pass a full ecological site and establish other such areas in the north?


Yes, Madam Speaker, I was in that area within the last two or three days. We have declared an ecological site there with the approval of many people. I believe the news report upon which the hon. member has founded his question is erroneous. We are not giving Panarctic permission to drill. We are not approving drilling in the Polar Bear Pass. In fact we have been negotiating with Panarctic over some years to relinquish all of the claims that have existed heretofore.


Madam Speaker, is the minister saying that Panarctic has not been granted any licence to drill in the Polar Bear area? If that is correct, fine. If it is not correct, will the minister make sure that licences to drill for either oil or gas will be rescinded in view of the fact that Panarctic has a very bad track record in polluting the north and leaving all kinds of drilling garbage around the sites.


Madam Speaker, I do not think the hon. member listened to my answer to his first question, unless he wanted to make somewhat of a speech by way of a second question. I already indicated the relinquishing of any preexisting claims by Panarctic in the area is being negotiated, we think successfully.


Madam Speaker, my question is directed to the Secretary of State for External Affairs. Following the latest bombings carried out by Israel over Beirut, which I can only qualify today as being totally

unacceptable, could the minister tell us whether he has lodged a protest with the Israel authorities and whether he will be expressing his sympathy with the Lebanese and Palestinian people?


Madam Speaker, I have, in fact, decided to protest again to Israel, and I have also announced I am recommending that the Canadian ambassador and his staff leave West Beirut, for their own safety and also to safeguard Canadian interests.


Madam Speaker, my question is for the President of the Treasury Board. There have been several estimates of the number of employees employed by Maislin Transport. The hon. member for Northumberland-Miramichi has mentioned 770. We have heard 1,000 and
2,000.	But what we do know is that there are at least 4,500 employees of Maislin Transport. Does the 6-5 restraint regime apply to the American employees of Maislin Transport?


Madam Speaker, the commitment of Maislin applies to its Canadian employees.


Madam Speaker, I wish to address my question to the Prime Minister. Section 37 of the Canada Act requires the convening of a first ministers' conference within one year of the proclamation of the Constitution, making the effective date April 17. Has the Prime Minister contacted the provinces concerning acceptable dates for that first ministers' conference, and is he considering February, 1983, for that conference?


Madam Speaker, I have not corresponded directly with the premiers on that particular date, but I have discussed with the native leaders optimal dates. February and March are dates they have suggested. I have instructed my officials to contact their opposite numbers in the provinces to see if there would be agreement on that. I have not yet had a report.


Madam Speaker, my supplementary question is also directed to the Prime Minister. As he
knows, Section 37 requires that at least one agenda item be on the table for that first ministers' conference, namely, the definition and inclusion of aboriginal rights in Canada's Constitution. Is he seeing that first ministers' conference as fulfilling that responsibility only, or is he considering other agenda items? If so, what might they be?


Madam Speaker, it would be my intention to consider the addition of other items in a subsequent or precedent conference, both of them back-to-back, if the premiers are agreeable to discussing other items. As the hon. member pointed out, the Canada Act obliges us to have a meeting on that one subject. There is no obligation on the other subjects, but I am open to discussion on any other items which the premiers would want to see put on the agenda.


Madam Speaker, my question is directed to the Secretary of State for External Affairs. Can he say whether or not the Canadian ambassador is being recalled from Beirut because he has requested his own recall, or are we simply removing a source of acute embarrassment to Israel by this recall?


Madam Speaker, I had left the decision to the ambassador as to whether or not he felt he should leave at any time. He did not exercise that discretion. But as a result of the heavy bombardment over the weekend and the fact that our staff there has been subjected to pressure for so long, plus the difficulties we are now having communicating with them- with electricity and other services unavailable, it was very difficult to get through-I felt that the time had now come to ask them to close the embassy in West Beirut and to operate as effectively as they can for the near future from the suburb of Jounieh.


I have the honour to inform the House that the Clerk of the House has laid upon the Table the reports of the Clerk of Petitions stating that he has examined the petitions presented by hon. members on Friday, July 30, 1982, and finds that the petitions meet the requirements of the Standing Orders as to form.

Order, please. One cannot give notice of a question of privilege on a point of order. The proper way to give notice of a question of privilege is to send to the Speaker's office a brief statement on what is the subject matter of the question o
