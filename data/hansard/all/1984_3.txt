Mr. Speaker, it is my intention to underline the continuing tragedy of unemployment. Inability to find employment to provide for one's own needs and those of one's dependants is a demoralizing experience. It undermines one's self esteem and results in frustration and fear.
Unemployment is of particular concern to the youth in this country in that the rate for this group stands at over 20 per cent. This is a tragedy of unconscionable proportion. Starting out with visions of service, achievement, and financial security, young people are shocked to discover that their services are not wanted. Their expectations are shattered, and their hopes dashed.
Our young people are now suffering a second blow. Unable to find employment, many have decided to return to classrooms rather than remain idle. Recently we debated the lack of funding for post-secondary education. Tuition fees are rising dramatically, and those with limited financial resources are unable to pursue their studies. As well, many educational institutions are raising entrance requirements, and now, suffering a double-whammy, many of our young people are facing a situation which will have a shattering effect on their future.
The Government, Mr. Speaker, has been delinquent in not providing permanent employment opportunities for our youth or the economic stimulation that will enable the private sector to create those opportunities.


Mr. Speaker, further to statements made before the Committee yesterday by the Quebec Minister responsible for Health, Mr. Johnson, and also to an
article in the newspaper La Presse which said that there were no user fees in Quebec in the health services field, I would like to go back to what Mr. Johnson said on Pierre Pascau's program last week on CKAC, when he admitted there might be 7,000 cases in the Province of Quebec. Now, I do not know when Mr. Johnson was telling the truth, whether it was here or on the radio in Montreal, but I do know that this afternoon, Mr. Johnson's officials came to see officials of the Department of National Health and Welfare and discuss this serious problem. This, in fact, confirms comments made yesterday in Committee to Mr. Johnson, that Bill C-3 has shown that Quebec's supposedly perfect health services system has a number of flaws which have been there since the PQ came to power, because it is a fact that Quebec owes its efficient health services system to the Government of Mr. Robert Bourassa.


Mr. Speaker, today we are joined by representatives of the Canadian Baltic community. This will mark the twelfth year in which parliamentarians have recognized the contributions of this community towards making Canada a better country in which to live. This occasion also presents an opportunity for all Canadians to reflect on the fragility and importance of our freedom.
The families of the Canadian Baltic communities who still live in Latvia, Estonia, and Lithuania have not experienced the advantages of freedom we are so familiar with in Canada. They have been struck by the tragedy of the loss of their freedoms. Members of this House are all aware of the desire for independence and freedom for which the Baltic people continue to fight. We in Canada can assist them by protecting our freedoms and way of life as diligently as they strive for their freedom and independence.
Canada is a bastion of freedom in a troubled world, a shining example of what many captive peoples strive for. Let us not forget whenever we demonstrate any weakness, be it economic, military or political, we are robbing those people living in Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia of the hope and inspiration they need to sustain their continuing and sometimes discouraging fight for freedom.

February 22, 1984


Mr. Speaker, tonight will be our twelfth annual Baltic Evening on Parliament Hill. Over the years the celebrations have heightened our awareness of Latvian, Estonian, and Lithuanian Canadians and their contribution to Canada's multicultural society. One aspect of Canadian multiculturalism is the encouragement we give to cultural and linguistic retention.
In the area of heritage languages the Baltic Canadians have had one of the highest retention rates of all Canadian ethnocultural groups. The community's continuous efforts in preserving and sharing its cultural heritage enriches all Canadians.
Furthermore, they have also pressed hard for basic human rights in conformity with the principles embodied in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in the Charter of the United Nations. Their dedication to the principles of freedom, democracy, and human rights is a constant reminder to us all of the treasures of great value which we possess and which must be shared by all Canadians. These principles must become part of the promised Multiculturalism Act we intend to have in Canada.

Mr. Speaker, when he appeared before the Standing Committee on Health, Welfare and Social Affairs yesterday, the Minister of Social Affairs for the Province of Quebec stated that Bill C-3, which relates to health and hospital services in Canada, would adversely affect the elderly and young children, especially.
Mr. Speaker, I am truly sorry to see the people of Quebec being brainwashed by false information that is strictly the result of an interpretation of Bill C-3 that is as erroneous as that given by the Provincial Minister. Free medication for the elderly and dental services for children from 0 to 15 years are not the kind of health services covered by Bill C-3 and are not among the services paid for by both levels of government.
Mr. Speaker, with respect, I fail to understand why the Minister of Social Affairs of the Province of Quebec is trying to scare Quebecers with his alarmist statements that have no basis in fact.


Mr. Speaker, in his presentation of the Budget on February 15 the Minister of Finance (Mr. Lalonde) stated that beginning this summer he will discuss with his provincial counterparts the possibility of introducing a homemaker's pension. I would urge the Minister of Finance to do more than simply discuss this important proposal recommended by the parliamentary Task Force on Pension Reform. I urge him to carry into his talks with the Provinces an absolute commitment to the homemaker's pension to be introduced at the earliest opportunity. I urge this in particular on behalf of the wives who are partners in Canada's many thousand family farms, in recognition that the farm wife is an integral and essential component of the family farm, sharing in the duties and labours, usually without financial reward because the farm income will not support it.
This is in contrast to the statements attributed to the Minister responsible for the status of women who said last year, "It is only the more affluent families in our society who allow a woman to stay at home."
I therefore urge the Minister of Finance to commit himself fully to the introduction of a homemaker's pension for all the homemakers who contribute so much to our society, but in particular for the many thousands of farm wives without whom the family farm, as we know it today, would cease to exist.


Mr. Speaker, a constituent of mine is unhappy with the attitude and course of action taken by Revenue Canada. This gentleman, a retired school teacher, found it necessary to sell his cottage. The cottage was sold by a reputable real estate company. The closing was handled by a respectable law firm, and his tax matters were taken care of by a well known accounting firm.
In May, 1982, he received a refund from Revenue Canada of $365. In July, 1982, he was reassessed for the amount of $950 and was told, "You are required to pay ... immediately, otherwise legal action, either by way of garnishment or action in the Federal Court, which could result in seizure and sale of assets, may be initiated without further notice".
This gentleman is 81 years old and, along with his wife, supports their grandson. What would Revenue Canada have garnisheed? His Old Age Pension? Would they have seized the assets of a retired couple in their eighties, including their rocking chairs? What has happened to old fashioned fairness, justice, and equity?
February 22, 1984

Mr. Speaker, this 81 year old man paid the $950, but the attitude and methods of Revenue Canada will surely have to change.


Mr. Speaker, in the spending Estimates tabled yesterday the federal Government announced it would be cutting job creation program money which would go to adults. For example, the Canada Works Program will be cut in half by some $440 million. As a result of that cutback many Canadians who have benefited from that program, and similar programs in the past, will be unable to get assistance from the federal Government at a time when there are well over two million unemployed people in the country. As long as there is such a high unemployment rate it is immoral for the federal Government to take this action.
Earlier today it was announced that Sherritt Gordon Mines in northern Manitoba would be shutting down its operations in Leaf Rapids. The people involved will be looking for assistance and jobs. The attitude of the federal Government in cutting money at a time when unemployment is so high does nothing to help those people or the many Canadians who need help at this very difficult time in their lives.


Mr. Speaker, it is unfortunate to find that thousands of Canadians living on limited incomes stand to lose money this year as a result of a federal tax change. The loss affects people over 65 who receive pensions from provincial workers' compensation boards. Previously workers' compensation board pensions were never taken into consideration in calculating whether someone over 65 was eligible for the federal Guaranteed Income Supplement. Under the change which takes effect this year, workers' compensation board pensions are now to be counted as part of a person's income.
This means, Mr. Speaker, that many pensioners who in the past qualified for Guaranteed Income Supplement benefits will no longer qualify, or will qualify for less assistance. This tax change will affect some 25,000 needy senior citizens. What it amounts to is a cutback in needed funds for pensioners. People who, last year and the previous year, were entitled to the Guaranteed Income Supplement, are now being denied it. This is an inequity that must be addressed and made right.
Oral Questions
The Minister of National Health and Welfare (Miss Begin), when she proudly referred to the extra $50 a month in supplement payments for single senior citizens, hastened to add that she hoped the provincial Governments would not increase costs to those seniors receiving benefits because of this increase. I think the shoe is now on the other foot and it is the federal Government which is penalizing needy seniors by this tax change.
Therefore 1 call upon the federal Government to rescind this obnoxious legislation which will cause untold hardship for a group of seniors who can ill afford a reduction in income.


Mr. Speaker, my question is directed to the Minister of Employment and Immigration. He will know that we have been trying to get information on the Special Employment Incentives Program since November of 1982. Yesterday he provided us with a bundle of material which included information on the Special Employment Initiatives Program. We now know that of $184 million spent to date under the Special Employment Initiatives Program, 80 per cent went to Liberal constituencies and less than 12 per cent went to Conservative constituencies.
Given the fact that this program was denied public input and was denied the input of Members of Parliament other than Liberals, how can the Minister responsible for Employment and Immigration stand in his place and justify denying these funds to the unemployed people in those constituencies not held by Liberals?


Mr. Speaker, the hon. gentleman asserts that those are the facts about the distribution. I do not know whether those figures which he has cited-


Oh, oh!


-are correct or not. But it would not necessarily be very surprising, since Members on the other side of the House have been saying week in and week out that they have not bothered to apply for funds under the program.
Quite clearly, if one looks at the provincial distribution of the funds, since there are Provinces which do not hold Liberal Members, there are funds which have gone to Provinces where there are no Liberal Members and therefore have clearly gone into constituencies held by Opposition Members.

February 22, 1984
Oral Questions
The hon. gentleman says that Opposition members have not known about the program to be able to apply for it. The fact is that some Opposition members have. I have no difficulty in defending this program.


That is because you are a Liberal.


It seems to me to be a little bit of sour grapes on the part of Members on the other side, that they have not cared enough to work as their Liberal colleagues have to find funding available to serve their constituents.


Hear, hear!


Members on this side of the House did not apply because the Minister told us last November 29 not to apply until we received the criteria, and we did not get the criteria until February 2.


Hear, hear!


The Minister will have to try a little harder.


Mr. Speaker, I will ask the Minister to account for funds spent under this Program by his own Department. Surely he will know something about what was spent by his Department. Under this program his Department spent $86.5 million. Of that amount, 73.5 per cent went to Liberal ridings, 9.1 per cent to Conservative ridings, and 3.2 per cent to NDP ridings. I want to ask-


Hear, hear!


1 hear those Liberals shamefully applauding the fact that they have discriminated against the unemployed in this country.


Hear, hear!


How does the Minister justify this shameful, partisan misuse of public funds?


First, Mr. Speaker, the hon. gentleman's citation of what I said to him in committee is not accurate, and if you refer to committee records you will see that that is so.
Second, I think it is appropriate to look at the funds expended on job creation to all of our project directed efforts. If he does that he will see, as I have said repeatedly, that the funds are distributed over-all in a way which largely reflects the distribution of unemployment. It is possible to take one program or another program and show that the impact of that program differs from that basic principle. In every case there are justifiable explanations for it.
The hon. gentleman, having asked repeatedly in the House for the facts, and all the facts, not wanting to see the material
massaged, so anxious himself, as he said to the House, that he would prepare the constituency breakdown, now finds that all of the facts do not substantiate what he would like to do. He wants to make a selective use of part of the facts to substantiate a case, which he cannot do.


Hear, hear!


Mr. Speaker, the Minister has shamefully tried to hide the facts, wrapped in a red ribbon.


Hear, hear!


I have the record here of what the Minister did say in committee on November 29. He said this to me:
When you receive the criteria, if you believe there are some useful projects in your area which would meet the criteria, you send me the suggestions and 1 will consider them.
That is what he said, and I did not get the criteria until February 2.
We have not seen anything like this since the early 1950s when they had horses on the payroll in Petawawa.


Hear, hear!


Oh, oh!


Now it is only one end of the horse.


And now we are seeing the other end of the horse.


Oh, oh!


Mr. Speaker, the Minister said this morning on public television that it was not possible to allocate these moneys by constituency. I was advised, and I have since been supplied with material which indicates that every constituency receiving an allocation under every make-work program in this country is allocated a code. These are the codes.
Can the Minister of Employment and Immigration tell us why he was not able to provide a constituency breakdown since that breakdown exists in his office by virtue of the use of this code? Why did he mislead the people of Canada?


Hear, hear!


Resign, John.


And you want to be leader?


Mr. Speaker, there are three questions contained in the Hon. Member's over-all question. The first was whether or not I said he should not apply, and clearly the words he himself quoted said that when he had the criteria, I would be happy to consider projects suggested by him. I did not say that he could not send any projects until he received those criteria.
February 22, 1984


Oh, oh!


Resign, John.


Tell him what to say, Marc.


The second accusation which the hon. gentleman put forward was that he has a list, photocopies, or I do not know what, which contains some constituency allocation code. It is true, Mr. Speaker, as has been well known, that there are some programs on which information is collected by us on a constituency basis, for instance, in Canada Works and in some of the Summer Canada programs. That does not apply to the Special Employment Initiatives Program over all, which the hon. gentleman opposite was inquiring about. The Special Employment Initiatives Program is broken down into three parts-


Pork barrel; pork barrel; pork barrel.


-first, the funding which applies to ordinary or other government programs; second, to programs which are within the Employment and Immigration Commission, which are there in a regular way. The third element within the Special Employment Initiatives Program is the Employment Creation Grants and Contributions Program.


Your nose is getting bigger all the time.


What I can say to the hon. gentleman, after having made inquiries, is that we do not collect that information in relation to the Special Employment Initiatives Program on a constituency by constituency basis.
The third thing the hon. gentleman has accused me of doing is trying to conceal the facts to the House. That is exactly why I presented-


Oh, oh!


-presented all of the information on all of the projects, which is what the hon. gentleman asked me to do. Back on February 14 he said, "Don't massage it. Don't launder it. Mr. Speaker, would the Minister make available to the House the unexpurgated lists?" Will we-" that is to say, he is saying he-"We will figure out the constituencies."


And we did.


I gave them the unexpurgated lists. I have given them all the details. Now they complain they have information that does not substantiate the twisted use they want to make of a partial selection.


Hear, hear!


Mr. Speaker, my question is for the same Minister and it is on the same topic. As the
Oral Questions
Minister will know, it is a tradition that all federal job-creation programs are dealt with through a public process. It gives everybody an equal opportunity and an equal chance in all regions of the country. However, in this program to which my colleague referred, there was no public process. There were no application forms publicly available. There was no public information campaign to let Canadians know how the program operated. Indeed, in the Minister's own regional offices there was no public information available. It boils down to this. This Minister and this Government have used millions of dollars of taxpayers' money-


Question. Question!


-in order to convert them to Liberal Party patronage. That is the charge; that is the reality.


Hear, hear!


How does the Minister think he can justify that to the House and to the people of this country?


Mr. Speaker, the Hon. Member obviously has a very tendentious association with the facts of the matter. The facts of the matter are that the program was announced and underlined in two Budgets, one presented by my colleague, the Hon. Minister of Finance, and one by the former Minister of Finance, the present Deputy Prime Minister. I cannot understand how there could be a much more public process than the presentation of a program within the context of a budget debate.


Oh, oh!


The explanation for the program has been given to the Hon. Member time and time again. It is not my difficulty if the Hon. Member cannot comprehend it. What we were seeking to do, and what I think the facts now show we did, was establish a fast-track process by which we could create jobs.


Oh, oh!


Members on this side of the House knew of that program and Members on the other side of the House knew of that program. Perhaps they were too preoccupied with their own internal affairs of choosing a new Leader to take advantage of that program, or perhaps they were too preoccupied with getting rid of their old Leader to take advantage of that program. The programs were there. They could have applied. Some of them did. Most of them did not. It is not our fault that they have now found out that we are being active in pursuing the interests of our constituents. Would that they had been just as efficacious in doing the same!


Hear, hear!


Oh, oh!

February 22, 1984
Oral Questions


It surprises me that the Minister has no shame in this matter. It surprises me. The record is clear. There was no public information until February 1 that people in this country could use. That is the fact of the matter; that is the record.


Hear, hear!


Mr. Speaker, I want the Minister to remember this, as I ask him this question: what the Minister has done-and I ask him to think about it before he gives the answer-is that he has converted public programs for unemployed people from no longer being on the basis of need but to whether they know Ministers of the Crown. That is what the Minister has done. That is the shame of it. How does the Minister think that he can stand in the House and say otherwise? The reality is that job-creation programs by this Government are no longer done on need but on Liberal Party need.


Hear, hear!


Mr. Speaker, the hon. gentleman is very agitated, and there was so much noise around him I could not understand the first two-thirds of his question. The last part of his question, the assertion that these grants were given on the basis of some special knowledge or acquaintanceship with Ministers of the Crown, is clearly false.


Mr. Speaker, my question is also directed to the Minister of Employment and Immigration. It is no wonder that Members are agitated. We have done a breakdown of the grants that were given in the Province of Ontario. Over 90 per cent of all grants under the Special Employment Initiatives Program were given to Liberal ridings.


Shame!


Out of $56.4 million granted under this program, only $3.5 million was allocated to other than Liberal ridings in the Province of Ontario.
The Minister knows full well that last September, when he was appointed Minister, he issued, along with a press statement, a piece of paper which reads, "Government of Canada Job-Creation Programs". Nowhere on that paper is there any reference to the Special Employment Initiatives Program. Therefore, members of the Opposition were not given access to the program, were not informed of the program. I ask the Minister, is it not reasonable to conclude on all of the evidence that we have before us that this money was allocated on the basis of Libera! patronage and that, in order to gain access, you had to be a Liberal, or know a Liberal?


Hear, hear!


No, Mr. Speaker, I do not believe that that is a proper conclusion to be drawn. The Hon. Member is in error in saying that these funds were given to Liberal ridings. These funds were given to groups, to people-


To Liberals.


-to citizens of this country who wanted to use those funds to create jobs. They may have been in Liberal ridings, but they were not given to Liberal ridings. They were given to people who wanted to create jobs, and not jobs just in constituencies but all across this country and all across the regions of the country.


Mr. Speaker, is the Minister suggesting that those people in other than Liberal ridings, those citizens who live in other than Liberal ridings were negligent that they did not apply, and that they did not care? Is there some reason to believe that they were aware of the program and did not get access because they did not care about it? The fact is, and the Minister knows it, that the information was never distributed across this land, was never given to members of the Opposition, that only Liberal members were told what they could get, and the reason why the money is so clearly allocated to Liberal ridings is because it was a Liberal patronage fund. Deny it if you can.


Hear, hear!


No, Mr. Speaker, I am not arguing that the citizens of Canada are negligent. The Hon. Member himself just said that he did not know about the program. That program was underlined in two budget statements in this House. The only thing I can conclude is that he did not listen to those budget statements and that, I would think, is negligent.


Hear, hear!


So was the Western Canada Development Fund.


Hear, hear!


Mr. Speaker, I want to ask the Minister whether it was just by accident that the amounts of money allocated to ridings or to areas of the country in which there are no Liberal members is considerably less than the amounts of money allocated in constituencies, or for that matter in areas of the country, where there are Liberal members? Is it just by accident that where there are Liberal members in the Maritimes, Quebec, and Ontario, the amounts
February 22, 1984

of money allocated per capita are considerably higher than in areas in western Canada where the amounts of money are less than half the amounts made available in areas where there are, in fact, Liberal members?


Mr. Speaker, it is not surprising that in the eastern part of the country where unemployment levels are considerably higher that there should be a higher proportion of funding going to those areas. If you look at the-


What about British Columbia?


The Hon. Member says: "What about British Columbia?" The over-all expenditure under the direct programs, the over-all percentage for British Columbia, is 13.7 per cent. The proportion of unemployment in British Columbia is 13.8 per cent. The figures are almost identical. Would the hon. gentleman stand in his place and say: "If you look at the Section 38 program, one of the programs on the list, that 27 per cent of the funds went to British Columbia"? That really shows the Liberals are bending over backwards to hurt the Opposition ridings in the country. That level is almost twice the percentage of the ratio of unemployment in British Columbia to the country as a whole.


Mr. Speaker, I remind the Minister that we are talking about the Special Employment Initiatives Program. I wonder if the Minister would explain, in this very obvious attempt to obscure the truth from the Canadian people, how much money, how many hours, how many persons were employed to produce this far more detailed information on programs that was not asked for, to create the snow job we saw in this House yesterday in an attempt to bury the real information on the Special Employment Initiatives Program that was asked for just after the Budget of 1982.


Mr. Speaker, now we see clearly their purpose. Last week they wanted the facts, all the facts, nothing but the facts. They wanted the facts so that they could make the allocation judgment themselves. They wanted to know the whole story. Now they do not want the whole story. Now they want that little piece of the story that they think they can twist to support their point of view which is not justifiable in terms of the facts as a whole.
Members on the other side were saying: "Give us everything. Don't massage it. Don't transform it. Don't order us." That is what we gave to them. In order to do that, it is true we did have translators, we did have special staff working all through the weekend to provide that information for Members opposite. You know, Mr. Speaker, if we had not done that and I would have had to delay even longer, they would have been up on their feet charging me with not respecting the House of
Oral Questions
Commons because I was not prepared to deliver the information to them when I had promised to do so.


Hear, hear!


Mr. Speaker, I would like to address a question to the same Minister. It will not need to be distorted by the wealth of information which he deposited in the House yesterday. How can the Minister justify the issuing of a letter by the Metropolitan Toronto Separate School board, the Catholic School Board, urging all of their trustees to contact only Liberal Members of Parliament on the providing of funds to upgrade educational facilities in Toronto? The list is clear. It is addressed to all the trustees. The list includes only names of Liberal members. Will the Minister please explain how that could come about?


Mr. Speaker, to the best of my knowledge I have not seen or I am not aware of the letter to which the hon. gentleman has referred. I gather it is not a letter over my signature, but a letter sent by the trustees of the Separate School Board. I am not responsible for the trustees of the Separate School Board. I do not think I have seen the contents of that letter, but if the hon. gentleman's accusation is that the trustees of the school board are urging the citizens of Canada to be in touch with Members of Parliament, Liberal or any other kind, then it seems to me to simply indicate that the trustees believe that Liberal Members will likely do a better job of being responsive to their interests than Members opposite.


Hear, hear!


Oh, oh!


Mr. Speaker, my question is directed to the Minister of Employment and Immigration, who has clearly misled the House when it comes to the Special Employment Initiatives Program. Why won't he admit to this House that B.C., which, as he knows, has an unemployment rate of 13.8 per cent, nearly 14 per cent, which had more mortgage foreclosures, more business bankruptcies in the recovery year of 1983, than in the recession, why won't he admit that it received only 5.5 per cent of the $186 million in this sleazy, slush fund?


Hear, hear!

February 22, 1984
Oral Questions


Mr. Speaker, the Hon. Member simply should refer to the over-all figures which show that, on direct project programs, the Province of British Columbia and the Yukon have received 13.7 per cent of the funds in comparison to an unemployment rate of 13.8 per cent, so it is roughly equivalent. She should also remember that direct job-creation programs are part of a much larger government effort, and that the economic stimulation brought in by the Budget of my colleague, the Minister of Finance, something like $2.5 billion worth of stimulation, would have a much bigger impact in British Columbia, Ontario, and Alberta than in some of the less advantageous and less rich Provinces in this country.
She should also remember that it is not simply the federal Government which has an obligation to worry about creating jobs, but also provincial Governments. Part of the situation which exists in her Province is because there is a Government in that Province so sympathetic and of such a similar stripe to the Leader of the Opposition and his Party opposite. We require a partnership in job creation and it is not surprising that we should expect the Provinces, those best able to do so, to do more of the work as well.

a (1440)


Mr. Speaker, my question is directed to the Minister of National Health and Welfare, whose Bill is before a Committee of this House.
Could the Hon. Minister give the House the assurance that, unlike what was stated by the Minister of Social Affairs of Quebec, the purpose of the Bill under consideration is not to get rid of the system of agreements and substitute therefor a series of unilateral decisions, or at increasing federal powers to the detriment of the provinces or at preventing Quebec from exercising its jurisdiction and setting its own health priorities, and finally, that its purpose is not to penalize children by taking away dental services, and the elderly, by depriving them of free medication?


That doesn't concern you, it concerns Quebec!


Mr. Speaker, I can give the Hon. Member the formal assurance that the Canada Health Bill is aimed only at prohibiting out-of-pocket charges to patients. In Quebec, patients receive free health services and health care because these have already been paid for through the health insurance plan. Quebec can call it whatever it likes, but extra-billing will not be allowed, and I am sorry to say this is not negotiable. As
far as the rest, the agreements and all that sort of things is concerned, it is now time, in Committee, to negotiate and to decide whether one word rather than another should be used. We have no intention of invading areas of jurisdiction, and in any case, we do not have the resources. It is up to the provinces to shoulder their responsibilities. Everything is negotiable, except the principal of free health services and the list of insured health services for Quebecers.


Mr. Speaker, my question is also for the Minister of Employment and Immigration. People in British Columbia have been betrayed by the Government's unfair allocation of Special Employment Initiatives Projects. Across Canada the Government allocated an average of $ 150 per unemployed person for these projects. While the Maritimes received projects amounting to $227 per unemployed person, and Quebec $206, British Columbia is right at the bottom of the heap with only $60 for each unemployed person.
Can the Minister explain why special employment funding dropped so dramatically in western Canada where there are no elected Liberals? Could he say what is fair or equitable about a project and program where British Columbians get only 40 per cent of the help given to other Canadians?


Mr. Speaker, the hon. gentleman talks about betrayal and bottom of the heap, but 27 per cent of the funding under Section 38 went to British Columbia. Is that betrayal? If you look at the job-creation programs over all, 13.7 per cent of our funding went to British Columbia. That is almost exactly the equivalent of their percentage of unemployment. That is not being at the bottom of the heap.


Out of the slush fund.


The hon. gentleman should look at all of the figures and not pick and choose selectively from among them.


Mr. Speaker, the Minister should know that Section 38 was mainly oriented toward the forest industry and that British Columbia has the majority, or a large percentage, of the forests of Canada and it needs that funding.


Mr. Speaker, my question refers to the Special Employment Initiatives Program, or the Liberal slush fund. We have always shared in equalization payments with the rest of Canada. Now when we are in difficulty we are not getting our share. Will the
February 22, 1984

Minister make more money available for job creation and ensure that this is given on an equitable basis right across Canada-on the basis of the needs of unemployed people rather than on the needs of Liberal members to get elected?


Mr. Speaker, as I have pointed out to the hon. gentleman, the money is given on an equitable basis. He may not care about the situation of the forest industry in this country but people on this side of the House do. We want to see reforestation take place, we want to see marketing take place, and we want the forest industry to remain as it is in Canada, the number one employer of people. We want it to maintain its vitality.


Mr. Speaker, my question is also for the Minister of Employment and Immigration regarding the money spent by Canada Post under the Special Employment Initiatives Program. The Minister will know that the NDP did not receive any of that money under this program, that the PCs received 4.3 per cent of it, and we are thankful for that, but that the Liberals received 95.7 per cent of the money.


Shame!


Can the Minister stand up in this House and say with a straight face that 95.7 per cent of the most urgent needs of Canada Post could only be found in Liberal ridings?


Mr. Speaker, what I am saying to the House is that, apparently to the dismay of the Opposition, what we have found is that there are over 50,000 projects for direct job creation in this country as a result of these activities. I am not too surprised that they are a little bit embarrassed about that. If they think back to the recent past they will find that in 1979 they tried to cut these job-creation programs out of existence. It may be that they are a little bit embarrassed because the official spokesman for the Conservatives said yesterday, after he had had the chance to look informally through the material, that it looked as if the job funds had been divided equitably. That was the initial impression and statement of the official spokesman of the Opposition Party.


I didn't say that.


I suspect, Mr. Speaker, that between this initial and accurate impression and what is happening in the House today, some of his colleagues have got to him in the belief that they can make political capital out of what is a sound job-creation program benefiting Canadians in every region of the country.


Start telling the truth.

Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister responsible for twisting on behalf of the Government, the Minister of oink, oink, the Minister of Employment and Immigration.
Newfoundland has the heaviest unemployment in Canada. I have written to the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans on dozens of occasions, listing projects needed. How is it that under the Special Employment Initiatives Program $4,639 million was spent in Newfoundland under Fisheries and Oceans to date, 100 per cent in Liberal ridings-not one cent, not one red cent, not one jot, not one tittle spent in either St. John's East or St. John's West?
When the Minister is explaining that, can he explain why, in his own Department where over $4.2 million was spent on projects so far in Newfoundland, 99.3 per cent was spent in the Liberal districts and .7 per cent in the PC districts? Can he explain that? Can he explain why he is trampling on the unemployed in these two districts? You are a disgrace to this House.


Mr. Speaker, if you were describing Members in this House on the basis of twist, the hon. gentleman there would be a double convoluted corkscrew.
I put it to the hon. gentleman that over 12 per cent of the money in Canada Works went to Newfoundland-


I gave you that figure.


-as opposed to their national average of unemployed of 3 per cent.


Let us deal with the 300 million.


In the NEED program, almost double their average of unemployment went into Newfoundland. The same is true for the summer programs in 1983 and 1982.


We are dealing with the program for 300 million.


Three times the percentage of the Community Development Projects went into Newfoundland.


You are a bloody liar.


Over all, more than double the percentage of funding went to Newfoundland in comparison to their percentage of unemployment.
My question to the hon. gentleman is very simple. Which of those projects in Newfoundland would he like us not to have done?

Just wait until the electors get their hands on you. They are never going to forget. Let us go to the people tomorrow and see what they think. They are going to batter you, you gutless wonders.


Mr. Speaker, my question is directed to the Minister of Employment and Immigration. Under the so-called Special Employment Initiatives Program the two Liberal held ridings in Prince Edward Island received a whopping $2,400,000. By contrast, the two Progressive Conservative held ridings in Prince Edward Island received a paltry $215,000. That is a discrepancy of 11 to one in favour of the Liberal ridings. Does the Minister think that the taxpayers of Canada are gullible enough to believe that such a huge discrepancy can be justified by the comparative jobless figures across the Province in those four ridings? Or will he, instead, admit that the program in question is blatant political corruption on a national scale?


Hear, hear!


What about the Veterans Affairs headquarters?


Mr. Speaker, I am a little surprised at the Hon. Member's question because, as the figures clearly show, on every one of the programs of direct job-creation, Prince Edward Island has received far more than the percentage which would be equivalent to the percentage of unemployed. If the hon. gentleman is concerned about us somehow not favouring his riding in Prince Edward Island, I would remind him that the federal Government is spending virtually $20 million-$19.5 million-for the establishment of the veterinary college in his own constituency.


Oh, oh!


Accidents will happen.


Clearly we are out to salvage the Hon. Member.


I would like to call the attention of the House to the presence in the gallery of the Honorary Consuls of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania.


Hear, hear!


Mr. Speaker, my question is also directed to the Minister of Employment and Immigration. I want to return to the issue of rewarding friends and punishing the unemployed. According to the Estimates tabled just yesterday, the Government will give an increased amount, up to $1,600,000,000 in PIP grants, to its oil company friends, while the unemployed across Canada suffer cuts of some $300 million in total federal grants and contributions for job-creation programs. With respect to the Government's policy of rewarding its friends, which is so evident in its political allocations between Provinces through the Special Employment Initiatives Program-not all the others-does this cut mean that that discrimination also applies across the board as between oil companies on the one hand and unemployed Canadians on the other?


Mr. Speaker, I think the Hon. Member's question is a bit convoluted. Since when are the oil companies such great friends of this government? He should try visiting Calgary when he gets away from the British Columbia coast some time.
I believe there is some substantial essence in the Hon. Member's question. I believe it was about the Estimates. I would just like to remind the hon. gentleman that what we have seen now are the Main Estimates, which are added to as the year goes on by Supplementary Estimates. Therefore it would be inappropriate for him to draw conclusions on the basis of the comparison I believe he was making, if I understood his figures correctly.


Oh, come on, John.


As to friends and enemies, I wish I had the sort of political enemies which gave me the thousands of dollars a year that his so-called enemies in the oil companies give him. Let us get it straight.


According to those same Estimates, Mr. Speaker, there has been a 40 per cent increase in PIP grants to oil companies for drilling dry holes, while forestry spending is down by 61 per cent to only $45 million.


Shame.


Forestry employment programs which the Minister talked about earlier today, are down from $21.5 million to only $60,000. That is a cut of 99.998 per cent. There will have to be a lot of supplementary estimates to make up that difference. Have the Minister and his Government given up on the forest industry? Have he and his Government given up on the unemployed of Canada? If not, when will they do an

about-face and provide some help for the people and the resources in this country which really need help the most?


Mr. Speaker, the answer to the two rhetorical questions, to each of them, is no. This Government is considerably concerned about the state of the forest industry. Indeed, if the Hon. Member will think back, he will recall the over-all forest strategy which we have prepared and presented in conjunction with the Provinces, dealing with reforestation, marketing, and the need for highly qualified manpower personnel. However, in answering the question in this way, Mr. Speaker, as his question really demands, I am trespassing on the responsibilities of my colleague, the Minister of the Environment, who is responsible for the forestry service.


Mr. Speaker, my question is also directed to the Minister of Employment and Immigration. Everyone has been speculating today about the Prime Minister's resignation. I cannot for the life of me understand why the Minister did not resign at least 35 minutes ago, in view of some of the statements we have been getting.


Hear, hear!


I would like to ask the
Minister about one of his statements this morning. He said: "There is nothing politically partisan about spreading around the Special Employment Initiatives Program." If that is true, how can the Minister explain 10 projects in the four Liberal held ridings of Niagara Falls, Welland, Lincoln and Hamilton East, and in exactly the same area, three Conservative held ridings, Burlington, St. Catharines, and my own riding of Hamilton-Wentworth, get zip. Along with the riding of Hamilton Mountain, represented by the House Leader of the New Democratic Party, these ridings receive not a whisper for job creation. If that is not "operation slush" in action, I do not know what is.
I would like an explanation from the Minister of why the Liberal ridings in an area which is suffering from a high number of unemployed, as well as all of southern Ontario, by staggering coincidence, got all of these millions of dollars for job creation?


Mr. Speaker, the Hon. Member says he cannot understand, and I can understand that he cannot understand. Comprehension was never his strong point.


Oh, oh!


What he should be looking at, as we have reminded him again and again, is the total impact of the program. If he had bothered to do that he would have noticed that in the Erie constituency which, if memory serves me correctly, is represented by a Conservative Member of Parlia-

ment, something like $19 million worth of federal funds has gone in to create jobs-


Not on that program.


Talk about the slush fund, John.


-in the Fleet aircraft industry.


Oh, oh!


The simple fact of the matter is, Mr. Speaker, that what has happened here is that the Hon. Members of the Opposition somehow sensing a conspiracy everywhere-here a plot, there a plot, everywhere a plot, plot-believe that something nefarious is going on.


Everywhere an oink, oink.


Old McRoberts had a farm.


What they in fact found out is that there are 50,000 job-creation projects all across this country-[DOT]


And they did not do that.


-allocated, on the whole, fairly.


Project Oink, Oink.


There may be I doubt not, that in 50,000 projects there are some which will look, when taken out of context, to be dubious. I cannot argue that in 50,000 cases we always made the right decision. However, what we have in fact done, to that Party's surprise, almost to its dismay, is bring into the open that there is a tremendous amount of effort on the part of this Government to create meaningful jobs all across this country.


Hear, hear!


They seem unhappy about that.


Oink, oink.


Those Hon. Members would rather that the figures showed some kind of political manipulation, because what they are really interested in is not the passion for creating jobs, Mr. Speaker. That is not their passion. Their passion is a lust for power.


Hear, hear!


Brian. Brian.


Mr. Speaker, I would suggest to the Minister that truth obviously is not the Minister's strong point.


Right on.

My question is directed to the same Minister. The construction industry has an unemployment rate of 33 per cent. In Ontario it is 29 per cent, and many of the unemployed are young people. Why was 90 per cent of the CMHC funding under the slush fund spent in Liberal ridings? Why was it not distributed fairly across the country? Why did the Minister not address the needs of the unemployed, rather than the needs of the Liberal Party?


Mr. Speaker, I say to the hon. gentleman, as I said repeatedly, the funds were distributed equitably. I would remind the hon. gentlemen opposite who are so concerned about bias and patronage that it was the Leader of the Opposition who said that if he became Prime Minister it will be 15 years before a Liberal got a job, and if he became leader of the Government, it would be 15 years before a Liberal constituency got a project-


That is false.


-not us on this side of the House; it was the Leader of the Opposition.


Hear, hear!


Mr. Speaker, I think from what we have seen today that it was the Minister's constituents who made the mistake when they gave him a job.


Mr. Speaker, the Minister said numerous times today, and in the past, that the reason Conservative ridings have not received anything under this program is because we have not worked hard enough and have not applied.


That is right.


Mr. Speaker, when 1 did not have the criteria for this program I called the Minister's office in the first week in December. After being referred to six different people in that office we were advised by Mr. Len Westaburg that this program was one being developed by the previous Minister but since this Minister had come into office it had not yet been initiated, but when it was we would receive the information. If the Minister wants us to work hard and get these programs, could he tell me how I can apply for a program which has no criteria, no application forms and, in his own office, does not exist?


Mr. Speaker, I suppose the best advice I could give to the hon. gentleman is that he should have consulted with his
colleague, the Hon. Member for Joliette, who said he was aware of the program and believed his colleagues were as well.
