I have notice of a point of order that I want to take before we go into Routine Proceedings. Normally I would hear it under motions, but I will hear it as a point of order.
Mr. Speaker, I will be brief. My colleagues and I consider this to be an important matter regarding adjudication by the Chair.
This morning's notice paper contains a notice which I gave yesterday pursuant to Standing Order 81(4) to extend consideration of the estimates of the Department of Human Resources Development beyond the normal date of expiration.
Normally the Leader of the Opposition would give such a notice and tomorrow it would be deemed adopted by the House. However, the Leader of the Opposition has neglected his obligation to use all means to hold the government to account by giving to all members of the House an opportunity to pose questions of the government with respect to billions of dollars of expenditures for authorization.
In the instance of the employment insurance program there are significant issues which I know all members of my party, and I suspect all members of the House, would like to be given the opportunity to address. I know there is no direct precedence in this matter to guide you, Mr. Speaker.
I readily acknowledge that the standing order specifically names the Leader of the Opposition as the member who is entitled to give this notice. However, the closest analogous situation may be found in the the citation 924 at page 257 of Beauchesne's sixth edition. In the case of a conflict among the opposition leaders over the use of an allotted day the Speaker has intervened where there is a breakdown of the informal House leadership machinery.
I believe some analogous precedent can be drawn here. In this instance the failure of the opposition and the Leader of the Opposition places every member of the House at a disadvantage. All of us on both sides of the House have operated under the assumption that this debate of the estimates would continue, at least for this one department, past the May 31 deadline because of the expectation that the Leader of the Opposition would move his motion under Standing Order 81(4).
There are urgent questions which all members want answered with respect to the granting of supply in the Department of Human Resources Development. I humbly submit we should not be denied this opportunity, simply because the Leader of the Opposition has failed in his duty to have the entire House given this opportunity.
The Leader of the Opposition was not prepared to let the House of Commons do its work in this important area. This party is prepared and we are asking, Mr. Speaker, that you grant this discretion. Given the abrogation of the responsibility to the whole House by the Leader of the Opposition, I ask that you permit this party and myself as House leader of this party to give this notice which would be considered under Standing Order 84(4) of the standing orders.
I submit that it is within your discretion, Mr. Speaker, to transfer that power which is normally reserved solely for the Leader of the Opposition to another opposition party which has gone through the normal procedures that would be followed in this matter. We have made the effort to do that and to follow the precedent and procedure that are set. I would ask that the Chair to adjudicate on this matter and I thank the Chair for its indulgence.
Mr. Speaker, I was not really prepared for this point of order, but in terms of the statements by the leader of the fifth party of the House all I can say with respect to Standing Order 81(4) is that it is in the opinion of the House leader for the Conservative Party.
What the Speaker has heard this morning is politics and just politics. I would caution the Speaker that what we could be looking at is that every pet project of every opposition party in the House could suddenly become subject to challenge under this section.
Mr. Speaker, it is quite clear that Standing Order 81(4)(a) says that the Leader of the Opposition may give notice. Given that this is optional and the Leader of the Opposition may give notice, it could also be that he may not give notice.
One is a direct corollary of the other. This is not rocket science. It is easy for anyone to understand that if it is optional to do something, it is equally optional not to do the precise thing in question, in this case giving notice to extend the consideration of the estimates.
Perhaps it is the opinion of the Leader of the Opposition that the estimates are just fine the way they are and he wholeheartedly supports them. We will find that out on June 9 when we get to that stage. Meanwhile it is strictly optional on the part of the Leader of the Opposition to do whatever he or she likes with regard to proposing or not proposing such an extension. He is fully within his right to do or not to do just that.
By extension, it has been alleged that because the Speaker has discretionary authority on the determination of which party will have the use of an opposition day during the supply cycle, in the event of a dispute that provides authority for the Speaker to intervene in this case.
There are a number of differences. First, in the case of supply, authority is invested with the Speaker to make the determination. In the case of Standing Order No. 81(4)(a), there is not the discretionary power granted to the Chair. The standing order is quite clear. I do not believe it was ever the intent of the standing order to make it such that the Speaker could overrule the standing order. The speaker obviously interprets the standing order and always does so in a very judicious and excellent manner. However, this is a different proposition altogether.
Members may have legitimate grievances, but there are three supply days left in this cycle. I am sure that during those supply days we will have the opportunity to listen to the grievances of the people as expressed through the normal supply cycle process.
Finally, of course, the government is accountable every day at question period and always provides excellent answers to both the hon. member across and all of his colleagues.
Colleagues, I find this to be a serious point. With your indulgence, I would like to inform myself more. I am aware of the standing order as pointed out by all three parties that have intervened in this.
I just want to look a little further at the citation the hon. member for Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough takes from Beauchesne's sixth edition. I am going to reserve judgment and I will come back to the House and make a decision on this.
Mr. Speaker, pursuant to Standing Order 36(8), I have the honour to table, in both official languages, the government's response to four petitions.
Mr. Speaker, pursuant to Standing Order 32(2), I have the honour to table, in both official languages, the annual report of the Chief of the Defence Staff for 1998-99, entitled “Into the New Millennium”.

moved for leave to introduce Bill C-514, an act to protect human health and the environment by reducing automotive pollution.

Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to table a bill aimed at protecting human health and the environment by reducing automotive pollution. This bill is governed by the precautionary principle according to which the lack of scientific certainty must not be used as a reason to delay appropriate measures if there is a risk of serious or irreparable harm to human health or the environment.
The bill will prohibit the production or import for use or sale in Canada, or offer for sale in Canada, of any gasoline that has an oxygen content of less than 2.7% by weight or any diesel fuel that has an oxygen content of less than 5.25% by weight, or any gasoline that contains the additive MMT. This would take effect on July 1, 2003.
(Motions deemed adopted, bill read the first time and printed)
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to present a petition signed by 26 citizens of my riding which reads as follows: “We, the undersigned residents of Canada, call upon”—
Order, please. It is out of order for the hon. member to read petitions to the House. In compliance with the rules, he may give a brief summary of the petition. I would invite him to do that rather than read the petition which, as he knows, is contrary to the rules.
Mr. Speaker, this petition calls upon parliament to enact an immediate moratorium on the cosmetic use of chemical pesticides until such time as their use has been scientifically proven to be safe and the long term consequences of the applications are known.
Mr. Speaker, I have a petition from the Inuit community of Kangiqsualujjuaq, in Nunavik.
According to the petitioners, from 16 to 24 people live in three bedroom housing units during the winter. The Inuit find housing arrangements in Nunavik to be extremely disturbing. The situation is deemed to be absolutely intolerable. It contributes to the high incidence of tuberculosis, infectious diseases and social problems.
The federal government must fulfil its obligations under the James Bay and Northern Quebec Agreement regarding housing in Nunavik.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to present a petition on behalf of a number of my constituents expressing concern about Canada's continued role in the NATO bombing of Kosovo and asking the government to reconsider its policy.
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise to present a petition on behalf of Canadian citizens living in my home town of Onoway.
These petitioners pray that parliament preserve the institution of marriage as it has always been known and understood in Canada. I agree with the petitioners.
I know the hon. member knows the rules demand that he not express his support or opposition to a petition he presents but to merely present the petition. I know he will want to comply with the rules in that regard.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to present a petition from citizens of Peterborough concerned about cruelty to animals.
The petitioners point out that there is mounting evidence of a link between animal abuse and domestic violence and violence against people in general, and that the Criminal Code regards animals as property and offences against them are little more than property offences.
The petitioners call upon parliament to work toward swift and effective action to modernize Canada's laws dealing with crimes against animals and that the penalties for such actions be made strict enough to act as a deterrent against such behaviour.
Mr. Speaker, I would like to present a petition from citizens of Peterborough who point out that the people of Iraq have suffered untold hardship in the wake of the gulf war, and that far from helping to destroy the repressive government of Saddam Hussein, these actions, including the sanctions, have actually strengthened that regime and destroyed any useful opposition to it.
The petitioners call upon parliament to strongly appeal to the United Nations, the United States and Britain for a rejection of any further military action against Iraq, and call for a serious attempt at peace negotiations with Iraq and its neighbours. In order to build a stable and sustainable society in Iraq, that excluding an embargo on military materials, all other sanctions be lifted.
The petitioners urge that Canada vastly increase its efforts to provide food, medicine and infrastructure support in Iraq.
Mr. Speaker, if Question No. 159 could be made an order for return, the return would be tabled immediately.
Is that agreed?
Agreed. .[Text]
Question No. 159—
What is the total direct federal government funding to organizations and projects in the Nova Scotia Regional Municipalities of Cape Breton, the Town of Port Hawkesbury, and the counties of Inverness, Richmond, and Victoria?
Return tabled.
Mr. Speaker, I ask that the remaining questions be allowed to stand.
Is that agreed?
Agreed.
The House resumed from May 12 consideration of Bill C-32, an act respecting pollution prevention and the protection of the environment and human health in order to contribute to sustainable development, as reported (with amendment) from the committee; and of Group No. 1.
I wish to inform the House that there have been some changes to the voting pattern for the report stage of Bill C-32. The details concerning these changes are available at the table.
I also want to point out that Motion No. 216, which was included in Group No. 5, has been transferred to Group No. 2 for the purpose of the debate.
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to take part in the continuation of the debate today on Bill C-32.
I want to begin by saying what it is that we are discussing here in the House of Commons today. The background to Bill C-32, the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, is an act respecting pollution and the protection of the environment and human health in order to contribute to sustainable development. It is a reintroduction of Bill C-74 which died with the dissolution of parliament prior to the June 1997 federal election. It consists of some 12 parts and 8 divisions with a total of 353 clauses that include regulations on such things as toxic substances, exports and imports of hazardous waste, biotechnology, ocean dumping, vehicle emissions, fuels and fuel additives, international air pollution, enforcement and other environmentally related matters.
It is also noteworthy to tell the House and others that Bill C-32 underwent one of the lengthiest reviews in recent parliamentary history setting several records. The committee, chaired by the hon. member for Davenport, held some 59 meetings, 37 of which were on clause by clause review. More than 560 amendments were drafted for consideration, exceeding some other bills. In terms of our particular party and the member for Churchill River, the New Democratic Party submitted over 100 amendments at committee.
The committee determined that the health and environmental association of the bill was too weak. It accepted the notion that there was a pro-industry bias to require little action to act for environmental protection. The underlying theme was a complete devolution of the powers of the environment minister to any other federal department or government jurisdiction.
The committee review presented an interesting dynamic. The New Democratic Party, the Conservatives, the Bloc and several Liberal members pursued a mandate to improve environmental protection. The Reform support for the Liberal government agenda carried the majority of close votes on proposed amendments.
The bill, as amended by committee and referred to the House, is supportable. Although not perfect, there have been additions to ensure that the precautionary principle provides the basis for environmental protection and that the environment minister's ability to act to protect the environment and human health is retained. However, the NDP has very serious concerns that the government's report stage amendments could reverse committee improvements that strengthen Bill C-32.
I am aware that we are on Group No. 1 amendments. I will now turn to those and quickly outline the New Democratic Party's concerns in that area.
Group No. 1 removes the phase-out of the worst of toxic substances. It removes the achievement of virtual elimination. It weakens the committee effort to strengthen precautionary principle with government efforts to return cost effective restriction before taking protective measures.
We support Motions Nos. 26 and 83 which recognize precautionary principle to be added for legal clarity. We moved Motion No. 61 for improved inherent toxicity interpretation which removes restrictions to amounts or quantities.
The NDP supports the principles of pollution prevention and polluter pays. We recognize the balance between the environment and the economy, in other words sustainable development. We think that it can be a difficult task. We are not against industry. We are against polluters who place our environment and our human health at risk.
The links between chemical exposures and human health are proven beyond a shadow of a doubt. The links between the contamination of the environment and the damage and degradation to Canada's biodiversity, including wildlife, are proven.
The Great Lakes, an area, Mr. Speaker, that I know you grew up on the shores of and and so did I, became one of this planet's infamous laboratories in this regard. We remember only too well the near loss of eagles from damaged eggs, the near loss of the ability to reproduce. Mothers depended on fish from these lakes and passed the contamination on to their children and it will be passed on to their children. It is not anyone's fault; it is the fault of the previous unknown, the unproven.
In the far north, mothers in Canada's arctic have PCBs and a variety of chemicals contained in their breast milk. Another generation faces known consequences, including learning disabilities, shortened attention spans and an increase in behavioural problems. Again, it is not their fault. It is the fault of industrial practices from this century carried by the winds and waters for thousands of miles. It is the environment that is contaminated.
Wildlife studies demonstrate these effects are passed between generations. The adverse impacts continue throughout the next offspring, the next and the next.
The fault lies with those polluters who allowed and continue to allow the poisoning of our environment that supports life, including humans as a species. The fault lies with the manufacturers of these chemicals that poison our shared environment. It is a disgrace that there are toxic manufacturers that continue to make and ship those poisons to countries without laws or protections against the criminals.
The fault also lies with legislators, those elected representatives, politicians who could have acted and should have acted to protect their fellow citizens, the environment, the fate and the future of their children and tomorrow's children. The fault lies with those parliamentarians who ignore history, ignore the facts, ignore the science, and avoid the leadership and vision to protect the common good and our children.
On the Group No. 1 amendments specifically, I draw attention to a series of motions proposed therein that will continue to poison our environment and our lives. The House Standing Committee on Environment and Sustainable Development went through one of the most comprehensive legislative reviews in Canada's history.
We believe that the amended legislation can protect the environment and give the dedicated scientists and citizens who wish to protect our environment and human health the tools to do the job.
I regret to interrupt the proceedings but I think we will have to suspend the sitting for a few moments. The bells will ring to summon members back to the Chamber.
(The sitting of the House was suspended at 10.33 a.m.)
The House resumed at 10.51 a.m.
Mr. Speaker, I will wrap up my speech on the Group No. 1 amendments to the CEPA legislation. The New Democratic Party supports Bill C-32 as amended by the committee. We believe the amended legislation can protect the environment and give the dedicated scientists and citizens who wish to protect our environment and human health the tools to do that job.
However, a series of motions in this group removes the phase-out of the worst toxic substances. In the opinion of the NDP, Motions Nos. 1 and 2 set the stage for the Reform Party and the Liberal cabinet to appease their polluter friends and remove the need to phase-out the most persistent and bioaccumulative substances. We have to ask about the guiding principle.
Why do we not recognize that we must remove these toxic threats which continue to poison Canadians and our environment? The Reform Party and the Liberal cabinet only seem to be interested to “virtually eliminate” these substances, but the toxics will still be manufactured and used. They will still be emitted into the environment. There is still the threat of a spill or an accident and these are the most persistent and insidious chemicals that we know of.
The industry said when we were attempting to remove lead from gasoline that it would be a crisis. We were able to do that. There are a number of other things that we have been able to do over time that the producers of these products said would be a catastrophe. They said that they would go out of business if we did that. They screamed foul and they started a fear campaign. In the case of lead they said that there would be no more cars on the roads if we did not leave lead in gasoline and there were a number of other hysterical concerns.
We spend 45 minutes each day at question period when Liberal cabinet ministers, one after another, stand to condemn the Reform Party for all things that are wrong with this country and all things that are wrong with that party. As far as I am concerned, they spend the other 23 hours and 15 minutes doing the business of the Reform Party in producing very bad legislation for this country, and this is but one example.

Mr. Speaker, in addressing the Group No. 2 motions before us I thought that perhaps a little description might help those who are watching.
Most of the Group No. 2 amendments focus on federal-provincial issues. Eleven government motions put in place a 60 day limit for other governments to accept our offer of consultation. Over 40 Bloc Quebecois motions seek to provide a provincial veto against any federal action. Four government motions ensure French-English concurrence and two government motions enable consultation with crown corporations.
With regard to the 60 day limit on the offer to consult, the Government of Canada is committed to working co-operatively with provincial, territorial and aboriginal governments to protect the environment and health of Canadians.
One of the ways in which Bill C-32 will help promote co-operation is through provisions that require an offer to consult to other governments on proposed measures. For legitimate reasons other governments may not always be interested in consulting with the federal government on a proposed measure. In these cases we do not want the requirements to offer to consult to create unnecessary delays.
For this reason the government has introduced amendments that would allow the Minister of the Environment to proceed with a proposed measure if after 60 days other governments have not taken up that offer. This does not limit the amount of time for consultation, only the offer.
With regard to the Bloc Quebecois amendments, they would seek to remove provisions of Bill C-32 to recognize the national dimension of CEPA, the environmental protection act, and the federal government's leadership role in protecting the environment and health of all Canadians.
We know that political borders offer no protection against pollution. We also know that one government acting alone cannot meet today's environmental challenge.
In Canada, history has shown us that environmental success is linked to co-operation among governments, whether it is tackling acid rain or protecting the earth's ozone layer. Bill C-32 recognizes that co-operation is essential. The Bloc Quebecois motions, however, suggest that co-operation is a one-way street. It wants provincial governments to have a veto to prevent federal government action to protect the environment and health of Canadians.
The Bloc Quebecois wants to strip the bill of its power to make defence of the environment a national responsibility.
It wants to strip the bill of its power to promote federal government commitments to provide national leadership in environmental matters.
These Bloc Quebecois motions are out of step with the reality of the environmental challenges that we all face. All governments have a role to play. In its 1997 decision, the supreme court upheld the federal government's jurisdiction to control toxic substances in Canada.
Rightfully, the court pointed out that environmental protection required the involvement of all levels of government. This is what Canadians expect, and what they deserve.
Bill C-32 provides the federal government with new tools to assist it in doing its part to protect the environment. This is legislation that will benefit all Canadians.
Mr. Speaker, we are dealing with Group No. 2 amendments that, as the parliamentary secretary has said, deal mainly with the delegation of authority between provincial and federal governments.
These amendments have all been proposed by the Bloc and the government. Reform has no amendments within this group. However, we would also like to comment.
The Bloc amendments proposed by the member for Jonquière basically propose to give provincial governments a veto throughout the legislation. Reform has regularly been the first party to defend the interests of the provinces and when we are talking about federal interference, which these amendments would create, we certainly cannot support them. In environmental issues we have long called for the rationalization of laws between the provinces and the federal government. However, there has to be a working relationship. The provinces should not have a veto.
When the Standing Committee on the Environment and Sustainable Development studied the roles of the federal and provincial governments regarding the environment, it concluded that it did not have sufficient information to sort out whether there was an overlap, where there was an overlap and where the changes were needed. In fact, the committee called for greater study on the harmonization as it went forward.
It is interesting that this week the Commissioner of the Environment and Sustainable Development tabled a report which included a section on federal-provincial relations. The commissioner found that there was limited reference to environmental protection in the objectives. There were no stated requirements to assess the impact of agreements. Affected industries still face regulatory inconsistencies. There was no requirement for audit. There was no detailed accounting of f
