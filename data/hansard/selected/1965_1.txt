Order. On the eve of the 98th anniversary of Canada's Confederation I ask leave to make an announcement of interest and importance to all hon. Members, which should be of significance to all Canadians.
In the tragic fire of 1916 that destroyed the old Centre Block we lost one of the finest historical treasures, the monumental oil painting by Robert Harris of the Fathers of Confederation. That famous painting, which only exists now in copy, depicts the Quebec Conference of 1864. I know all hon. Members will be delighted to learn that an exact restoration of the Robert Harris painting is to be presented to the nation by Confederation Life Association. It will be hung in the Parliament Buildings, hopefully well before July 1, 1967. The artist commissioned for this challenging task is Mr. Rex Woods, of Toronto, who is noted for his portrayal of persons and events from Canada's past.
The success of our forthcoming centennial hinges on the imagination and leadership of government at all levels, voluntary and other organizations, business and individuals. I am sure this gift to the nation from Confederation Life will help to make Canadian history come alive, both for our own people and for those of other lands.

1. (a) 387
executed; (b) 257 sentences commuted.
Note: With respect to part (a), it should be noted, if comparing this figure with statistics previously given by years, that the total yields one more than the addition of the individual years because of the omission of one case in 1954 which has now been corrected.
2. (a) 33 inmates: 4, 1 year; 1, 4 years;

3. Nine of those persons who were released by parole or ticket of leave had to be returned to prison.
Note: In comparing the number of commuted sentences with the total of those who died in custody, are still in custody and those released, it should be noted that the latter figures do not include those who were commuted and were committed to mental institutions. In addition, records were destroyed in the fire of June 1962, at St. Vincent de Paul Penitentiary, so that the documentation is not complete. The National Parole Board also reports that no assurance can be given that its records are complete for the earlier years.


In what year. In what amount, and how designated, has the federal government contributed to alleviating national disasters beyond the financial ability of the provinces?


The information requested is given, for the years 1949-59 to 1961-62 on pages 4075 and 4076 of Hansard for October 28, 1963. The information for subsequent years is as follows: 1962-63, Nil; 1963-64, Nil; 1964-65, British Columbia, Port Alberni Flood, $250,000.
In addition to the foregoing, sums of $1.5 million in 1963-64 and $400,000 in 196465 were provided with respect to flood relief in the Mackenzie district of the Northwest Territories.


Is it the intention of the Government of Canada to contribute to the maintenance of the Fathers

of Confederation Memorial Building in Charlottetown and, if so, what amount is to contributed annually?


Yes; $100,000.


1.	On what occasions since July 1, 1867 has the Government of Canada been requested by any of the provincial governments for an intergovernmental exchange to implement an entente, or an accord or an agreement entered into by a province and a foreign power respecting matters within provincial jurisdiction?
2.	Briefly, what was the subject-matter in each case?


Mr. Speaker, the answer to the first part is as follows: Until approximately 40 years ago the occasion for a request of the nature specified in the question would not have arisen under the Canadian constitution. Any interest which a province might have had in participating in arrangements with other governmental entities was a matter falling within the sphere of responsibility of Her Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom. All arrangements concerning matters falling within provincial legislative jurisdiction and purporting to have effect beyond the boundaries of the province were either embodied in Empire treaties or were in the nature of internal arrangements between the various parts of the Empire. The constitutional position prevailing until then, coupled with the fact that in the meantime the provinces have only infrequently seen the need in practice for formal arrangements to be entered into with foreign countries on matters within their legislative jurisdiction, has meant that there have been few occasions in practice when the provinces have found it necessary to seek the assistance of the federal Government in this respect.
The answer to the second part is as follows. In 1958 the federal Government was asked by the Government of New Brunswick to facilitate the conclusion of an agreement by that province and the state of Maine for the construction of the Campobello-Lubec bridge. A similar request was received from the province of Ontario in 1959 in connection with an agreement to be entered into between that province and the state of Minnesota for the construction of a bridge over the Pigeon River. Details of the two occasions since
June 30, 1965

April 1963 on which the Government of Canada facilitated the arrangements between the province of Quebec and France have already been given to the House in answer to question No. 2,768 asked by the hon. Member for Edmonton West on February 23, 1965. The text of this answer can be found on page 11818 of Hansard for March 1, 1965. Since then the federal Government has been requested by the province of New Brunswick to facilitate the conclusion of an agreement between that province and the state of Maine for the construction of a bridge across the St. Croix River at Milltown.


1.	Under the Canada Student Loans Act (a) how many loans have been granted to students in each province since the proclamation of the Act (b) what is the total amount of such loans (c) are all Quebec students excluded from the application of the Act (d) if so, for what reason (e) if not, under what conditions may they qualify?
2.	What qualifications are required in order to obtain such a loan?
Questions
3.	Does a university student coming from Quebec, whose residence has been established for more than 12 months in another province, become eligible for such loans?


1. Under the Canada Student Loans Plan, loans may be made by banks and designated credit unions only on the basis of certificates of eligibility issued by the provinces participating in the Plan. These certificates are issued only to students considered by one of these provinces to be residents for the purposes of the Canada Student Loans Plan. The provinces have recently established criteria for determining which participating province is the appropriate one to handle a student's application for a certificate of eligibility. These criteria are contained in the approved report of the Federal-Provincial committee on residence which appears in Appendix "A" of Hansard of June 11, 1965.
(a) and (b) As of April 1, 1965, the number of students assisted and the amounts of certificates of eligibility issued by the participating provinces, were as follows:
Province Newfoundland Prince Edward Island Nova Scotia New Brunswick Ontario Manitoba Saskatchewan Alberta
British Columbia Yukon
Northwest Territories
Number of Students Assisted 732 431 2,450 2,008 21,287 2,259 2,965 4,481 4,650 12 9
41,284
Amount of Certificates Issued $	456,512

June 30, 1965
Questions
propriate authority of a participating province. To qualify, a student must (a) be a Canadian citizen or have landed immigrant status with 12 months residence in Canada, (b) be enrolled or plan to enrol as a full time student in a post-secondary course of study at an educational institution specified for the purposes of the Canada Student Loans Plan by a participating province, (c) have attained satisfactory scholastic standard, (d) actually need a loan to pursue his studies; and (e) meet the residence requirements in a participating province on the basis of the criteria contained in the approved report of the Federal-Provincial committee on residence referred to above.
3.	A university student coming from Quebec will become eligible to apply for a loan in a participating province 12 months after he has moved to that province if he is married or has established to the satisfaction of the province to which he applies that he is financially fully self supporting.


1.	How many parole officers are employed by the Department of Justice and what is their jurisdiction?
2.	How many of these are trained social workers?
3.	How many are university graduates in the social sciences?
4.	Does the Department make provisions for bursaries for the training of more parole officers and, if so, how many bursaries and for how much?


1. Forty five parole officers are employed by the Department of Justice. The jurisdiction of those employed in the field offices is geographically limited to specified areas and the duties include the direct interviewing of applicants for parole; the direct or indirect supervision of persons on parole and the maintenance of liaison with crown authorities.
Generally speaking, the jurisdiction of parole officers employed at headquarters is geographically limited to a specified area and their duties include the assembly of data necessary to the study of parole cases; the preparation of summaries, based on the data assembled, for consideration by the National Parole Board and the performance of incidental duties.
In addition to parole officers in the direct employment of the Department of Justice, parole supervision is also performed on behalf of the Federal Government by employees of qualified agencies in the corrections field.

5.	Originally it was the requirement that trunk services to the edge of a Federal-Provincial land assembly or public housing project area were to be provided by a municipality at its own expense. Early in 1964, Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation agreed that the cost of extending trunk services to a Federal-Provincial project could be allowed as a project development charge, provided the financial arrangements for these trunk services and the installation of services within the project area were the same as those applicable to privately-developed subdivisions. Since that time, the Townships of Etobicoke and Sandwich East have requested financial assistance to instal trunk services and the Federal-Provincial Partnership has agreed in each case to participate.

of a causeway-dam across Pictou harbour, Nova Scotia, at the mouth of the Middle and West Rivers?
2.	If so (a) who made these representations and what were the dates of such representations (b) what answer did the government give to these representations?


1 and 2. In a letter dated February 2, 1965, Hon. Stephen Pyke requested approval to route the trans-Canada highway across Pictou Harbour at the mouth of the Middle and West Rivers. The route was approved as requested on the basis that under the Trans-Canada Highway Agreement the federal government would participate only in the actual or equivalent cost of the most economical crossing for a two lane highway. The type of crossing to be used has not yet been established.


Are any discussions going on at the present time between the Government of Canada and the Government of the United States, initiated either by the Government of Canada or on behalf of any of the provinces, with regard to the improvement of the Alaska Highway through Canada and the possible construction of a direct route from the Maritime Provinces through the State of Maine to the Montreal area?


No.


1.	Are any discussions in progress between any of the provincial governments and the Government of Canada, relating to the construction of a so-called corridor road running from the Montreal area through Maine to the McAdam area of New Brunswick?
2.	Has the government received any proposals regarding such a road from the International Atlantic Corridor Road Committee?

2. No.


1.	Is it the intention of the government to amend the penal code in order to legalize lotteries in Canada?
2.	If so, when will such action be taken?
3.	If not, for what reasons will the code not be amended?


The most
recent expression of Government inten-

tion on this subject was contained in the press release following the federal-provincial conference held in November, 1963, as follows:
"Some provincial governments explained the difficulties they have in enforcing the provisions of the Criminal Code in respect of lotteries and gambling. Suggestions were made that the institution of provincial lotteries would alleviate the situation. Other provinces, however, opposed this suggestion. The Federal Government indicated that it had no interest in instituting a Federal lottery but undertook to consider the amendment of the Criminal Code in the light of the views put forward."
The government has not come to any decision as to what amendments, if any, should be proposed for the lottery sections of the Criminal Code.


1.	Does the Department of Transport have under consideration proposals made by the Northwestern Ontario Development Association that a new bridge structure be erected over the Kaministiquia River at James Street?
2.	Has the Department exchanged any correspondence and expressed any views or received any views from the Lakehead Harbour Commission on the need for such a structure and the relative responsibilities of the Department and this agency in such a project?
3.	What statutory authority or regulations in the hands of the Minister relate to the construction of a bridge over navigable waters?


1.
Several weeks ago Mr. Hubert Badanai, M.P., for Fort William accompanied by Senator Paterson gave the Minister of Transport a copy of a brief submitted by the Northwestern Ontario Development Association to the government of Ontario, but this brief does not contain any specific proposal of recommendation from the association regarding a new bridge structure though strong representations in favour of a new bridge were made by Mr. Badanai and Senator Paterson. The Department is, however, considering, in consultation with the Department of Public Works and the Canadian National Railways, the nature and scope of federal responsibility for a new crossing of the Kaministiquia River.
2.	The Department has deferred communicating with the Lakehead Harbour Commission on this subject until the completion of the examination referred to in answer to No. 1.
3.	In respect of railway bridges, the Railway Act and in respect of bridges in public harbours or over canals, the Department of Transport Act, Harbours Commissions Act,
June 30, 1965

1964,	the National Harbours Board Act and other Harbour Commissioners Acts.


Has the Canadian National Railways given any consideration to any part it may play in determining whether a new bridge structure is advisable over the Kaministiquia River at or near James Street?


The
Management of Canadian National Railways advise as follows: Yes, a representative of the Railways is a member of the committee formed to study the current problem.


1.	In connection with the medical investigation now being conducted concerning those veterans who were prisoners of the Japanese in World War II, what are the specific problems which require further study?
2.	Which problems are being studied by the Department of National Defence and why is the Department of National Defence being used for this purpose?
3.	When is this investigation expected to be completed?


1. The problems which require further study have to do with the validation of certain observations and evaluation of the significance of others.
2.	The Department of National Defence is involved to the extent that professional assistance is being given by specially qualified staff of that Department, as stated in the House on May 7, 1965.
3.	Some parts of the investigation have been completed and appropriate action taken. Attention is drawn to the statement of May 7,
1965,	regarding dental treatment. The study of other matters will be completed in phases, probably during the current year, but it is possible that some of the problems associated with the increasing age of the veterans will require continued study over a period of years.
