FIRST SESSION-TWENTY-NINTH PARLIAMENT 22 Elizabeth II
Published under the authority of the Speaker of the House of Commons by the Queen's Printer for Canada Available from Information Canada, Ottawa, Canada
Monday, February 12, 1973
Mr. Speaker, under the provisions of Standing Order 43, I seek unanimous consent to move a motion on a matter of urgent and pressing public interest. I refer to a recent disclosure by a national magazine that the government's failure to act upon recommendations concerning the control and use of heroin constitutes a serious national situation. I therefore move, seconded by the hon. member for Edmonton-Strathcona (Mr. Roche):
That the annual report of the Department of National Health and Welfare be forthwith referred to the Standing Committee on Health, Welfare and Social Affairs for consideration and report.


Is there unanimous consent?


Agreed.


No.


The motion cannot be moved.


Sounds like a fix!


Mr. Speaker, I ask leave under the terms of Standing Order 43 to move a motion on a matter of urgent and pressing necessity. I feel sure my friends in the Official Opposition will agree to the motion being put and I hope the government will give it at least a few seconds thought before saying no. I move, seconded by the hon. member for Vancouver-Kingsway (Mrs. Maclnnis):
That immediately on the passing of this motion the Leader of the Opposition be given five minutes in which to state clearly the program of pension increases to which he referred last night on CBC television, and in particular to state the precise figure to which his party would raise the basic amount of the pension provided under the Old Age Security Act.


Oh, oh!


Agreed.


I am doubtful as to the procedural acceptability of the suggestion proposed by the hon. member for Winnipeg North Centre.


But it was
agreed to.


I will inquire from the House whether there is unanimous consent to the motion proposed by the hon. member for Winnipeg North Centre.


Agreed.


No.


There is no apparent unanimity.


Who said no?


On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, I should just like it to be known that it was not we on the government side who refused unanimous consent.


Hear, hear!


So that hon. members will not be disappointed, may I say I shall be speaking, I hope, later this afternoon.


Hear, hear!


Mr. Speaker, pursuant to Standing Order 43 I rise on a matter of urgent and pressing necessity. Tomorrow, the Minister of Consumer and Corporate Affairs will be appearing before the Special Committee on Food Prices. Since the minister left some doubt, in reply to questions last week, whether or not he is prepared to make available to the committee all of the findings of the Prices and Incomes Commission, and in view of the importance of those findings to the committee which has to report to the House in less than two months, I would therefore move, seconded by the hon. member for Kingston and The Islands (Miss MacDonald):
That in the opinion of this House the Minister of Consumer and Corporate Affairs should make available to the Special Committee on Trends In Food Prices all background studies and recommendations of the Prices and Incomes Commission.


The House has heard the motion proposed by the hon. member for St. John's East. Is there unanimous consent?

February 12, 1973
Regional Economic Expansion


Agreed.


No.


There does not appear to be unanimity.


Mr. Speaker, I ask the unanimous consent of the House to present a motion under Standing Order 43 which I believe is urgent and can be passed without debate. The motion deals with the proposed tanker route down the west coast of British Columbia. In view of the recent decision by the United States Court of Appeals which has blocked temporarily the issuing of government permits for the building of a trans-Alaska pipeline, I feel it is essential that the Canadian position be made crystal clear. I therefore move, seconded by the hon. member for Comox-Alberni (Mr. Barnett):
That this House in this, the first session of this new parliament, express its unanimous opposition to the proposed tanker route from Valdez, Alaska, to Cherry Point, State of Washington, and that this decision of the House of Commons be transmitted to the United States government through official channels.


Is there unanimous consent?


Agreed.


No.


There is no unanimous consent. Does the hon. member for Calgary North rise on a point of order?


Yes, Mr. Speaker. As I heard the motion, I think it ascribed the decision to the United States Court of Appeals. My information is that it was the court of appeal of one of the states, and whether that decision will be binding on the other states is a question of jurisdiction.

I rise on a question of privilege, Mr. Speaker. Earlier, on a point of order, I questioned whether a court to which the hon. member for Kootenay West had referred was, indeed, the United States Court of Appeals. It is, in fact, the United States Court of Appeals and the hon. member for Kootenay West was right. The information I had was incorrect.


Mr. Speaker, I rise on a matter of urgent and pressing necessity, pursuant to Standing Order 43. In view of recent statements attribut-

ed to the Minister of Regional Economic Expansion that his department has prepared analyses on the economic structure and possible development of six regions of this country-the Atlantic provinces, Quebec, Ontario the prairie provinces, British Columbia and the Canadian northwest-and in view of an impending major policy announcement to the premiers of the Atlantic region that is undoubtedly connected with these economic development strategies, I move, seconded by the hon. member for Dartmouth-Halifax East (Mr. Forrestall):
That the annual report of the Department of Regional Economic Expansion be referred to the Standing Committee on Regional Development in order to allow the committee to study these analyses, and that the committee be reconvened forthwith for this purpose.


Is there unanimous consent?


Agreed.


No.


The motion cannot be put.


A point of order, Mr. Speaker.


The hon. member is rising on a point of order.


In view of the fact that according to the required rules of the House this report is already nine days late, in view of the fact that this party has been accused of being obstructionist, and in view of the fact on at least one other occasion the Department of Energy, Mines and Resources report was referred without debate, I appeal to the government House leader and to the minister to reconsider and to have this matter referred to the committee as soon as possible.


On the order: Government Notices of Motions: February 8, 1973-The Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development moved:
That the Annual Report of the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development for the year ended March 31, 1972, tabled January 22, 1973, be referred to the Standing Committee on Indian Affairs and Northern Development.
The notice of motion is transferred to and ordered for consideration under government orders at the next sitting of the House, pursuant to Standing Order 21(2).

1.	What has been the cost to the government of programs initiated since passage of the Official Languages Act?
2.	Of the total, how much has been provided to provincial governments for language instruction and what is the breakdown in assistance by province?
3.	Of the total amount spent by the government on federal program, what have been the programs and how much has each cost to date?


1. For
the period of January 1, 1970 to December 31, 1972, the cost of the various programs administered by the Depart-

ment of the Secretary of State under the Bilingualism Development Program has been $167,819,970.
2.	For the period of January 1, 1970 to March 31, 1972, amounts granted to provincial governments or provincial institutions may be broken down as follows: Newfoundland, $326,204; Prince Edward Island, $246,895; Nova Scotia, $1,679,530; New Brunswick, $10,540,116; Quebec, $73,293,456; Ontario, $34,133,769; Manitoba, $2,097,071; Saskatchewan, $1,099,627; Alberta, $2,062,234; British Columbia, $2,089,874; (a) Final figures for fiscal year 197273 are not yet available on a provincial basis, but payments of $39,449,760 have been made between April 1, 1972 and December 31, 1972 to provincial governments or provincial institutions; (b) For the period of January 1, 1970 to December 31, 1972, an amount of $801,075 has been spent in non-governmental sectors (national voluntary associations, linguistic research, etc.); this amount cannot be broken down on a provincial basis.
3.	The amounts spent by the government between January 1, 1970 and December 31, 1972, under the various programs administered by the Department of the Secretary of State are the following: (a) Assistance for education in the official minority language (English in Quebec and French elsewhere) and the teaching of the second official language (English in Quebec and French elsewhere) at the pre-university levels: $150,048,221; (b) Assistance for education in the official minority language and the teaching of the second official language at the university or teacher training levels: $12,692,169; (c) Technical and financial assistance in areas other than education (translation, language courses for provincial civil servants, etc): $551,154; (d) Summer language courses for students: $3,727,351; (e) Assistance in non-governmental sectors: $426,075; (f) Linguistic research: $375,000.


1.	Have any studies or research been undertaken by the Department of Transport into the feasibility of the construction of a rail line for the purpose of transporting oil and liquified gas from the production fields in the Arctic to points in southern Canada?
2.	Have any studies been made into construction and maintenance costs as between rail transport and pipeline transport of oil and gas?
3.	Have comparative studies been undertaken as to the effect on the ecology between these two alternate methods of transporting oil and gas?


1. The
Ministry of Transport has contributed towards funding the study "Railway to the Arctic" carried out in 1972 by the Canadian Institute of Guided Ground Transport, Queen's University. This report examines in a preliminary way the technical feasibility and the cost of rail movement of oil in the permafrost region from Prudhoe Bay on the Alaskan north slope to North American markets.
2.	Some tentative comparison of the cost of moving oil between different transportation modes were made by the Canadian Institute of Guided Ground Transport in connection with the "Railway to the Arctic" study. It is likely that because of interest in both these modes further comparative work will be done.

3.	No. However, the extensive information being collected on the environmental impact of pipelines in the North is applicable to all modes of transportation in the Mackenzie corridor and is being used to assess the environmental impact of the Mackenzie highway. Further studies on the ecological effects of the Mackenzie highway are also being carried out currently. The information from both these sets of studies would be largely applicable to assessing the ecological effect of any possible railway to the Arctic.

2.	Wolfville, Kings County, Nova Scotia, (a) (i) $6,000, (ii) $154,000; (b) The old post office building was not structurally sound nor was it large enough to accommodate the increased requirements of the Post Office Department. The complete renovation of the existing building and the construction of an addition would have cost more than the new modern building and would have meant displacing the post office operation for approximately one year.

1.	What were the names of the corporations which received cash grants under the Emergency Gold-Mining Assistance Act (EGMA), in each of the fiscal years 1968-69, 1969-70, 1970-71, 1971-72, 1972-73 to date and, in each case, what were the amounts of money committed and paid?
2.	What are the objectives of the program?
3.	Has the department conducted any evaluative study of the program and, if so, what was the date of the latest report?


1. In accordance with the act, gold mining companies receive assistance on a designated, i.e. calendar year, basis. The amounts paid in the years 1968
to 1971 inclusive are shown in the report on the administration of the Emergency Gold Mining Assistance Act for the fiscal year ended March 31, 1972, which was tabled on January 4, 1973. The Canadian gold mines did not sell any of their 1972 gold production to the Royal Canadian Mint and thus no assistance was payable for the calendar year 1972.
2.	The objective of the program is to provide financial assistance to long-established marginal gold mines. By enabling gold mines to extend their productive life, the assistance helps communities dependent on gold mining to adjust gradually to diminishing economic support.
3.	A comprehensive evaluative study was completed in 1970 prior to the renewal of the act at that time. This study was extended in 1972 for purposes of renewal of the act and is referred to in the annual report just tabled. The internal studies are confidential.

Mr. ]ohn M. Reid (Parliamentary Secretary to the President of the Privy Council): I am informed by the Departments of National Revenue and National Health and Welfare as follows. 1. The following figures reflect the total revenue collected by way of Excise Tax and Excise Duty on tobacco, cigars and cigarettes for the fiscal years 196162 through to 1971-72. However, the figures do not include sales tax revenue imposed by the Excise Tax Act, such revenue being recorded in one account with no distinction as to sources.
2. For the most part post office records of indemnities paid do not differentiate between loss or damage in the mails and loss by theft. Statements submitted by postal districts on a monthly basis reveal the following expenditures. Of the figures shown, 4.46 per cent represent international claims and 1.05 per cent of money paid international claims.

3. The length of time spent on enquiries raised in this part of the inquiry varies from hours to weeks to months and this type of statistics would be meaningless.
2. The amounts expended annually on the problems arising from the usage of tobacco are as follows:


1.	How many applicants were accepted for training as air traffic controllers by the Department of Transport in the Saskatoon district during the calendar years 1970, 1971 and 1972?
2.	How many completed the course of training and received certificates or diplomas?
3.	How many of those who completed the course and received diplomas are now employed by the Department of Transport as air traffic controllers?

Order Paper Questions


What action, if any, has the government taken to protect the farmland and property from the high water levels and impending flood conditions in (a) Dover township (b) Chatham township (c) Wallaceburg, Ontario?
Hon. )ean-Eudes Dube (Minister of Public Works): None. The policy of the Department of Public Works concerning shoreline erosion is that the government will contribute to the cost of shoreline protection in cases where erosion is directly attributable to commercial navigation or the presence of a federally owned structure. The department has in the past advised property owners of the types of engineering structures which could be used to advantage in their particular case but each case must be considered separately and on its own merit. Although some regulation of levels and flows is carried out on Lake Superior and Lake Ontario under joint action by the International Joint Commission, the general water level condition of the Great Lakes and in particular lakes Huron, St. Clair and Erie, are considered to be natural. Remedial measures for flood situations are a provincial responsibility and the federal government would only become involved in cooperation with the province in the event of emergency or disaster situations.
