Mr. Speaker, I rise under the provisions of Standing Order 43 to move a motion on a matter of urgent and pressing necessity, indeed a matter which is taken as being of the utmost seriousness by everybody except this government which treats it by casting aside questions and keeping the Prime Minister away from the House of Commons. Since the Prime Minister is responsible personally and directly for the integrity of this government and, more specifically, for the direction of national security activities by the government, I move, seconded by the hon. member for Grenville-Carleton (Mr. Baker):
That this House demands that the Prime Minister of Canada be in his seat in this chamber at 2 p.m. tomorrow in order to answer for the illegal activities and cover-up by his government.


Order, please. Such a motion can be presented for discussion only with unanimous consent. Is there unanimous consent?


Agreed.


No.


Mr. Speaker, I too rise under the provisions of Standing Order 43. Considering that I have been informed that a letter was written to the former solicitor general, now the Minister of Consumer and Corporate Affairs, by the director general of security of the RCMP, dated December 19, 1972, bringing to his attention information about the break-in at L'Agence de Presse Libre in the fall of that year, and considering that the former solicitor general has maintained that he did not become aware of this
break-in until March, 1976, I move, seconded by the hon. member for Winnipeg North Centre (Mr. Knowles):
That this House instruct the Solicitor General to search his files to ascertain if such a letter, referred to as document No. 26 in the proceedings of the Quebec Keable inquiry, exists.


Such a motion can be presented for discussion pursuant to Standing Order 43 only with unanimous consent. Is there unanimous consent?


Agreed.


No.


Mr. Speaker, I rise on a matter of urgent and pressing necessity, pursuant to the provisions of Standing Order 43, in view of tensions between federal authorities and provinces such as Alberta and Quebec which are holding inquiries into various aspects of the administration of justice and affecting the RCMP since there are constitutional and legal aspects involved which, in all likelihood, cannot be considered fully by these inquiries until several months have elapsed, I move, seconded by the hon. member for Grenville-Carleton (Mr. Baker):
That the Solicitor General and the Minister of Justice convene a conference as soon as practical with their provincial counterparts to explore, on an immediate basis, ways of mutual co-operation until such time as all of the commissions of inquiry, including the McDonald Royal Commission, have had a chance to come to reasoned conclusions and recommendations.


The presentation of such a motion for discussion requires unanimous consent. Is there unanimous consent?


Agreed.


No.

Mr. Speaker, under the provisions of Standing Order 43, I ask for the unanimous

consent of the House to present a motion dealing with a matter of very urgent and pressing necessity.
Considering the confusion which has been created by the illegal actions of the special RCMP committee which is responsible for the security of the state; given the general indignation among the Canadian people and considering that the government is directly involved in this inadmissible abuse of power, this situation resulting from their narrow views on the matter of national unity, I move, seconded by the hon. member for Villeneuve (Mr. Caouette):
That the authorities who are directly or indirectly responsible for this abuse of power be immediately fired and that, if any minister of the cabinet is involved, he should resign forthwith.


Order, please. The House has heard the terms of the motion put forward by the hon. member. The introduction of such a motion pursuant to Standing Order 43 requires the unanimous consent of the House. Is there unanimous consent?


Agreed.


No.


Mr. Speaker, I rise on a matter of urgent and pressing necessity under the provisions of Standing Order 43. In view of the fact that the public revenues of Canada have been used to purchase and operate a $1 million computer in the East Block due to an idea that "sort of bubbled up" in the Privy Council office, with expenditures hidden under administrative services for the Privy Council, and in view of the fact that one major function of this computer is a highly sophisticated press information retrieval system for the Prime Minister, and since a computer expert states it was intended as a support for the Liberal party and has essentially become a Trudeau research bureau, I move, seconded by the hon. member for Halton-Wentworth (Mr. Kempling):
That the members of the Privy Council office be ordered to desist from bubbling up expensive baubles for the Prime Minister and that access to the computer and its information be given to all political parties represented in the House so that no one will be tempted henceforth to bug the bauble or retrieve the Prime Minister.


The introduction of such a motion for debate pursuant to Standing Order 43 requires unanimous consent. Is there unanimous consent?


Agreed.


Mr. Speaker, I rise on a question of urgent and pressing necessity in accordance with Standing Order 43.
I move, seconded by the hon. member for Winnipeg North Centre (Mr. Knowles):
That in the light of the fact that the federal office of the New Democratic Party was broken into on December 3, 1972 the government be directed to institute full inquiries into the searching or breaking into the property of any political party in Canada.
I do not refer, as the minister did, to party headquarters only.


Standing Order 43 requires, for the presentation of such a motion for discussion, the unanimous consent of the House. Is there unanimous consent?


Agreed.


No.


Mr. Speaker, I wish to move a motion under Standing Order 43 on a matter of urgent and pressing necessity.
The statement in this House by the Minister of Veterans Affairs (Mr. MacDonald) to the effect that the basic rate of disability pension will not be increased because of economic restraint has caused widespread national concern and dismay on the part of veterans' organizations and veterans generally. This refusal by the minister makes a mockery of Canada's commitment to veterans of the First World War, the Second World War and the Korean War. I therefore move, seconded by the hon. member for Halton-Wentworth (Mr. Kempling):
That the matter of disability pensions for veterans be referred to the Standing Committee on Veterans Affairs.


Such a motion can be presented for discussion only with the unanimous consent of the House. Is there unanimous consent?


Agreed.


No.


No.

November 1, 1977


Mr. Speaker, under the provisions of Standing Order 43 I would like to move a motion of urgent and pressing necessity. In view of the fact that every reliable indicator and poll in the last five years has shown that about 80 per cent of the Canadian people want to see a return of capital punishment in Canada, and in view of the fact that yet another police officer, Sergeant Ronald McKean, was recently gunned down and killed in Collingwood, Ontario in the performance of his duty, and as the people of Canada should no longer have to tolerate the procrastination of this government in bringing forward a referendum on this important issue of national concern, I move, seconded by the hon. member for Parry Sound-Muskoka (Mr. Darling):
That the government take immediate steps to reinstate capital punishment in Canada.


The presentation of such a motion for debate requires unanimous consent. Is there unanimous consent?


Agreed.


No.


The question period would ordinarily begin at this time. I have received notice of a question of privilege by the Solicitor General (Mr. Fox) which has a basic indication that it may pertain to events which would ordinarily follow in the question period. I should hear it in a preliminary way first, and I will guard the proper time for the question period.


Mr. Speaker, I rise on a question of privilege which I believe affects the privileges of hon. members of the House and which, in the course of the information I will give, should materially affect the course of the question period today.
During the course of the emergency debate last night the hon. member for New Westminster (Mr. Leggatt) referred in his speech to a document which on its face purports to be a memorandum addressed by Mr. Robin Bourne of the security planning and analysis branch of my department to the Minister of Labour of British Columbia. The hon. member referred to the document publicly, in spite of doubts expressed himself as to its authenticity. I want to report to the House at the first opportunity today that the document did not originate with Mr. Bourne and that it is indeed a false document.


Shame!
Privilege-Mr. Fox


The paper it is written on is widely available in the Ottawa area. Further, the branch title is not correct. The document is unsigned, and the filing number is not even remotely similar to that used in that branch of my department. It is quite clear that the document is the work of a mischievous person or persons. Unfortunately, the hon. member for New Westminster, who expressed doubts about the document, did not choose to check it out with my office before making it public.


Shame!


It is my intention to turn the document over to the appropriate authorities for investigation. I sincerely hope that the hon. member for New Westminster would wish to-


Order, please. If the Solicitor General is permitted to raise matters which might affect the question period, he ought to be confined very strictly to the merits of those matters.


I would like to raise a second point, but I hope the hon. member for New Westminster wishes to co-operate fully with that investigation so that the mischievous person or persons may be known.


Hear, hear!


The other point is that yesterday the hon. member for Central Nova (Mr. MacKay) also rose on a question of privilege concerning a bugging device found inside his office. The hon. member, according to press reports, indicated that this could well be the work of the security service of the RCMP. I have had the matter examined and I can assure the House that I, as Solicitor General, never authorized any eavesdropping of the hon. member's office and can further state that the Commissioner of the force assures me that no such bugging was done on the criminal side of the force. However, we on this side believe this to be a matter of the utmost importance, requiring that a full, complete, investigation be carried out in order to determine who is involved in such a despicable act. I wish to assure you, Mr. Speaker, that if you so desire you can count on the complete co-operation of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in this regard.


How about the government?


This matter is far too important to be dropped with the passage of time. Insinuations have been made. It is time for insinuations to be replaced by the truth and the truth can only come out through a quick, complete and thorough investigation.


Hear, hear!


Mr. Speaker, 1 would first of all like to tell the House that I accept the explanation provided today by the Solicitor General (Mr. Fox)

November 1, 1977
Oral Questions
concerning the nature of the document in that it is what appears to be a sophisticated hoax.


Oh, oh!


But, Mr. Speaker, it is not unusual that any member of this House, given the kind of information that has been available to members in so many areas, would come to the conclusion that the document itself was legitimate. As I say, I accept the Solicitor General's explanation of course. I hope he will go further and not only tell the House that the document itself is false but that the information contained therein is false and that no intelligence activity of the nature alleged in the document took place with regard to the individuals named in the document.


Hear, hear!


I think if he could do that, it would certainly satisfy the House. I do accept his explanation concerning the document, however. I should say also that I am delighted he is following up with an investigation of the document because we are just as interested in getting to the bottom of these things as is the Solicitor General.


Mr. Speaker, I shall be brief. I want to thank the Solicitor General for his statement. I also want to ask a question for clarification- perhaps he has covered this point but I did not quite catch it- did he indicate that it was the RCMP on the criminal side only from whom he had received this assurance or does this assurance cover all aspects of the RCMP or related agencies?


All aspects of the RCMP, Mr. Speaker.


Order, please. Perhaps this has contributed to a more reasoned question of privilege on the basis of those matters that have been raised. In any case, the question period would have begun about seven minutes ago and I would therefore propose to continue it until about seven minutes past three.


Mr. Speaker, it was certainly refreshing and unusual for us to hear from the lips of the Solicitor General the phrase that the truth can only come out through a quick, complete and thorough examination. We certainly believe that and wish that the government would consequently pay more attention to our demands for a special committee inquiry. In the absence of the Prime Minister who should be here in the House of Commons today-


Hear, hear!


-my question is for the Acting Prime Minister. It relates to a letter to me from the Prime Minister received in my office on October 18 this year. I think it important that I quote it. It says in part:
I can, however, state unequivocally, that as long as I have been Prime Minister of Canada no Member of the Federal Parliament without his consent has ever been the subject of authorized surveillance, including electronic surveillance, carried out by the Security Service of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.
That is the end of the relevant quotation. I would draw to the attention of the House that the Prime Minister explicitly limited that guarantee to the security service of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.
In light of the revelation made yesterday by my colleague from Central Nova, I should like to have from the Acting Prime Minister the categorical statement that he has sought and received from the security service of the RCMP, and from any other security branch of the government of Canada, an assurance that the statement made to me by the Prime Minister is still operative.


First of all, Mr. Speaker, I should like to tell the hon. member that so far as presence in the House of Commons is concerned the Prime Minister has a much better record than he has.


Hear, hear!


I had a meeting this morning with the Solicitor General and I have nothing to add to what he had to report to the House of Commons today about the bugging of the office of the hon. member for Central Nova. He asked the RCMP and all branches of the RCMP, as well as any people involved in security, about this and they gave him their word that they were not involved. Because of the importance of this matter, Mr. Speaker, and because it affects all members of parliament, I urge Your Honour to take upon yourself the carrying out of a full inquiry so that we will know exactly who has done this bugging.


Mr. Speaker, the Acting Prime Minister very carefully avoided my question. Can we have a categorical undertaking by the Acting Prime Minister, on behalf of the government, that the assurance given me by the Prime Minister in a letter received in my office on October 18 is still operative and that it applies not simply to the security service but also to every other security agency of the government of Canada? Can we have that assurance?


Mr. Speaker, we have no security organization but the RCMP. The Prime Minister wrote this letter and we have no changes to make to it.


Mr. Speaker, since the Acting Prime Minister, acting in his capacity as Prime Minister for the moment and responsible for all the activities of the government, has now given me a categorical assurance-because that is what I
November 1, 1977

sought-that the undertaking given by the Prime Minister is still operative and that it applies to any security activity of the Government of Canada, will the Acting Prime Minister tell the House whether, before coming to the House of Commons with that assurance, he personally consulted with the director general of the security service, General Dare, with the head of the security planning and analysis branch group in the Solicitor General's department, Colonel Bourne, and did he receive from each of them the unequivocal and total assurance that neither group had any involvement whatsoever, or has had any involvement whatsoever, in the surveillance, electronic or otherwise, of any member of parliament? Has the Acting Prime Minister sought and received that specific assurance from those officers?


Mr. Speaker, 1 said earlier that I talked with the Solicitor General this morning and that he sought those assurances from the RCMP. He gave his answer in the House of Commons a few minutes ago and I am thoroughly satisfied with the word of the Solicitor General.


Mr. Speaker, we had on Friday the Solicitor General spell out for the House of Commons the March, 1975 mandate that is supposed to guide the activities of the security service of the government. Yet it has become evident that the government has been engaged in surveillance of individuals and groups who at best are involved in political dissent and not involved in subversion. This includes political parties, the media, labour unions and, for all we know, individual private Canadian citizens. What I want to know of the Acting Prime Minister or Solicitor General is who authorized the surveillance of political parties, the media and perhaps ordinary citizens of this country.


Hear, hear!


Mr. Speaker, that is a rather unacceptable question. Yesterday the Solicitor General replied to all questions. He made himself available to the public on Friday. He gave all the facts to the House of Commons as to who authorized the taking of the computer tapes in Montreal. Insinuations like that are not worthy of a responsible leader of the opposition.


Hear, hear!
PARTI QUfiBfiCOIS BREAK-IN-ACTION TO REFER TO SOLICITOR GENERAL OF QUEBEC


Mr. Speaker, I wish to direct my question to the Solicitor General. Last Friday the Solicitor General reported to the House that he had informed the authorities in Quebec of an illegal act involving
Oral Questions
the break-in of the Parti Quebecois headquarters in Quebec four years ago.


Oh, oh!


Those are his words. They are on the record. What we are dealing with here is the commission of two crimes. The first one has been referred to the attorney general of Quebec and quite properly so. What action has the Solicitor General taken to investigate what is a clear prima facie case of obstruction of justice under the Criminal Code by persons within his department or in his office? Clearly this would involve his predecessor, the present Minister of Consumer and Corporate Affairs, in a conspiracy or maladministration. Either way he stands indicted by the people of this country.


Mr. Speaker, if the hon. member cares to read my statement, he will see that at no point did I ever refer to a break-in at the Parti Quebecois headquarters. That is a statement that has been repeated a number of times by the leader of the New Democratic Party in spite of my repeated statements to the effect that that is not the case. It was a break-in in another building in Montreal which housed the computer tapes.


Oh, oh!


Further to that, the hon. member asked a question concerning possible obstruction of justice. During the course of my tenure as Solicitor General, I have had the opportunity of reviewing the Tiles concerning possible illegalities. In no case was there any evidence of obstruction by any one of my predecessors. On the contrary, all indications in the file are to the effect that as soon as my predecessor, the Minister of Consumer and Corporate Affairs, became aware of an illegal activity, he immediately advised the provincial authorities so that appropriate action could be taken.
PARTI QUfeBfiCOIS BREAK-IN-POSSIBILITY OF ACTION AGAINST DIRECTOR GENERAL OF SECURITY


Mr. Speaker, notwithstanding the statement made yesterday by the Solicitor General to my colleague, the hon. member for Egmont, to the effect that no one within the security service at the time, including the Director General of Security Service, considered this to be an illegal action, clearly an illegal act was committed and has been referred to the attorney general of Quebec. There are at least four sections of the Criminal Code that have been violated, including theft, break and entry, obstruction of justice and conspiracy. In the shameful absence of the chief law enforcement officer of this country, the Attorney General of Canada who has the responsibility here, I will direct my question to the Solicitor General. In view of the fact that he is obviously in a conflict of interest vis-a-vis his predecessor, the Minister of Consumer and Corporate Affairs, with regard to any attempt to commit a conspiracy under the Criminal Code, what action does the Solicitor General intend to take against the Director General of Security at the time who obviously
510

November 1, 1977
Oral Questions
knew that a crime had been committed? Also, what steps will he take to establish a clear objective and impartial inquiry into the operations of the office of the Solicitor General of Canada?


Mr. Speaker, it is obvious that instead of asking questions the hon. member wishes to act as a judge and, in the absence of due process, condemn people who have entered into certain activities. As far as we, on this side of the House are concerned, we are ready to let the due process of law take place. We believe that the proper person to decide whether someone is guilty or not is a judge who has heard all the evidence or all the facts.


Hear, hear!


The hon. member also asked about a possible conflict of interest between my office and that of the present Minister of Consumer and Corporate Affairs. It is quite clear that on this side of the House we have wanted to ensure that there is not even the slightest appearance of conflict of interest and that is why we have set up a commission of inquiry which has all the powers necessary to examine any illegal acts committed by the RCMP. Also, in spite of what members of the opposition have said and in spite of what the editorial said in the Globe and Mail this morning, the commission has the power to call the appropriate ministers before it. I might add that the appropriate ministers, both the Minister of Supply and Services and the present Minister of Consumer and Corporate Affairs have already indicated publicly their intention to respond to any request to appear in front of that commission.


Hear, hear!


I have a question for the Solicitor General as well, Mr. Speaker. It concerns the obstruction of justice, not on the part of his predecessors, but of himself. I should like to ask the minister why, having learned of the RCMP involvement in arson and theft, two very serious offences, and having informed the Macdonald Royal Commission in the middle of July of this year about such activity, he took more than two months before getting in touch with the police authorities in the Province of Quebec to inform them of the same activity.


The answer to that question is quite clear. It is interesting to note that the leader of the New Democratic Party accuses me of having obstructed justice when I have brought the matter to the attention of the royal commission of inquiry which he, among others, requested should be set up. We set up a royal commission of inquiry in order that there might be an independent, impartial body to look into these various allegations. We thought it would be improper for the RCMP to conduct a complete investigation of

those matters. We also thought it would be regarded by members of this House as an obstruction of justice if the RCMP had gone outside the force to interview, for instance, former members or other persons who might be involved in those acts.
For these reasons we referred the matter to the Macdonald Commission, but as we had some evidence coming forward of illegal acts we thought it would be proper to refer the matter to the Attorney General of the Province of Quebec. I find it rather an astounding proposition to hold that in cases where we have referred these facts both to a federal royal commission and to the Attorney General of the Province of Quebec that the hon. member would have the gall to talk about obstruction of justice.


Hear, hear!


Mr. Speaker, we on this side can put up with just so much rhetorical baloney. 1 have no objection to his informing the royal commission. The whole point of the question is that when the minister found out that there had been criminal wrongdoing involving arson and theft he took more than two months to inform the correct police authority so that they might investigate and prosecute. That is the question.


I answered the question previously-


Oh!


-I would point out to the hon. member that in the course of the debate during the month of June when I was saying that these questions involving criminal acts ought to be handled at the provincial level, the hon. member was telling us we were sending the RCMP to the dogs by confining them to a provincial commission of inquiry. The facts are there. We have referred the matter to police authorities. There are other allegations which have been made against the force and they have all been referred to the royal commission in order that they may produce the evidence. If they do come up with evidence, I would expect them to talk to me and to advise me to which attorney general I should refer it.


You have not answered the question! Rarely have I heard such blatant nonsense from a lawyer. It is just rubbish. My last question concerns his predecessor but it must be put to the Solicitor General because, in accordance with the rules of the House, his predecessor cannot answer. The former solicitor general, the present Minister of Consumer and Corporate Affairs, said in the House that he did not learn of the break-in of the office of L'Agence de Presse Libre which took place in the fall of 1972 until March of 1976. I was informed yesterday that a letter, signed by the Director General of Security, was sent to the then solicitor general on December 19, 1972 providing information about the break-in that fall. In view of the serious contradiction between those two alleged sets of facts, would
November 1, 1977

the minister investigate the situation and find out whether such a letter was sent on that date and whether it was received?


Read the letter!


Yes, Mr. Speaker.


Mr. Speaker, I know we have been discussing a very important topic in the last few days, but still we should not drop all other matters of importance in Canada. 1 should like to put a question to the Minister of State responsible for Small Business. Can he tell us whether the government, during the summer break which ended recently, studied the problems of small business in Canada and whether, as the minister in charge, he intends to take concrete steps, first, to define what small business is and, then, introduce efficient legislation to better protect it in Canada and enable it to develop normally?


Mr. Speaker, my predecessor spent a year studying the problems of small business and a good many of these studies resulted in-


More studies!


-a declaration by myself on his behalf early in my tenure outlining a ten-point program. But I will confess that the program is somewhat skeletal and thereby hangs a requirement to flesh it out in the coming months. I think that as time goes by we will be bringing in definitive programs which I believe will meet many of the problems faced by small business today. I cannot say they will meet all those problems because small business, like large business today, is facing very serious difficulties. I think we are going to bring in a number of measures-the hon. member is aware of the recent introduction of the CALURA amendments which will go a long way to reducing paperwork now faced by 70,000 small businesses.


Mr. Speaker, on a supplementary. As small and medium-sized businesses are an important source of employment both steady and new, can the minister tell us whether he intends to recommend that a committee of the House study the question as proposed recently, in ten points, by his predecessor?


Well, Mr. Speaker, I hope that when I introduce measures in the House I shall have the full co-opera-
Oral Questions
tion of hon. members. I trust that the hon. member for Abitibi will take part in the debate.


Mr. Speaker, I have a question for the Acting Prime Minister. In April of 1973 I directed a number of questions to the government. One of them was whether the government had considered or developed a scheme under the Defence Research Board, Shirley's Bay, to utilize the central telephone system in Ottawa to keep under surveillance all telephones in the Ottawa area. If that was not happening, I would have expected a direct negative answer from the Prime Minister. But his response was: "It is not considered in the public interest for reasons of national security to disclose the details of intelligence activities."
In the light of recent events, particularly those of yesterday, will the Acting Prime Minister tell us whether or not the Shirley's Bay establishment has the capability of utilizing the central telephone system in Ottawa to keep under surveillance telephones in the Ottawa area and, if it has that capability, whether it is being so used?
[ Translation]


Mr. Speaker, I am not particularly aware of this problem, but I will check and report to the hon. member. I do not think I am in a position to add anything to the answer given by the Prime Minister a few months ago, but I will check and if there is anything new about it, I will report to the hon. member.


Mr. Speaker, can the Acting Prime Minister inform the members of this House whether telephone calls, particularly long distance telephone calls, of members of this House were in any way monitored? Are there tapes being made of the conversations, particularly long distance telephone conversations of members? Does this capability to monitor and tape exist?


The answer is no, Mr. Speaker, because I do not think it is in our interest to do that. In a letter addressed to the Leader of the Opposition, the Prime Minister has made it clear that the government had never allowed anyone to monitor telephone calls or keep the Parliament Hill offices of hon. members under surveillance.
80025-33^2

November 1, 1977
Oral Questions


Mr. Speaker, either the Acting Prime Minister did not get the gist of the question or chose to ignore it.


Oh, oh!


My question was this: does the capability exist to monitor and tape telephone calls, particularly long distance telephone calls, of members? Perhaps he could reply to that at a later time after looking into it.
My final supplementary question is: if tapes are kept of telephone conversations, particularly long distance calls, are these tapes listened to on a regular basis at meetings of officers of various deputy ministers, for instance, the deputy minister to the Postmaster General?


Mr. Speaker, I do not know of any capacity or any capability of this organization to do that. We are here today experiencing a fishing expedition, and I think fishing is better in the Yukon than in Ottawa.


Hear, hear!


It depends on what you catch.


Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Solicitor General and it refers to two answers which he gave yesterday. Since the Solicitor General confirmed yesterday once again that the illegal break-in had been "authorized by the most senior level of the security service of the RCMP, and that was by the person holding the rank of director general", and later in an answer to me he said that the cabinet committee on security and intelligence did not know about the illegal break-in, arson and theft because "everyone within the security service at that time, including the director general of the security service, did not consider it to be an illegal operation", I wonder if he can tell the House what made the director general think it was legal? Why was the information on this activity deliberately withheld from the cabinet committee for a period of some years?


Mr. Speaker, I think there is a commission of inquiry which will have the full opportunity to explore those matters in detail.


This is the House of Commons.


It will have the opportunity of examining the director general and to hear his story. I do not intend to put words into the mouth of the then director general of the security service. I assume the proper place for this type of thing is in front of the royal commission of inquiry. We do not

see why we have set up a royal commission of inquiry if we are going to conduct an inquiry on the floor of this House.


Oh, oh!


Perhaps the hon. members opposite could make up their minds as to whether they want a royal commission of inquiry, for which they themselves pressed for a long time, or whether they want us to talk about the details on the floor of this House.


Hear, hear!


Mr. Speaker, the Solicitor General cannot have it both ways. He cannot make a statement in this chamber on Friday on one of the most important issues which has come before this House for some time and then expect that questions as to ministerial information and responsibility are not going to be answered in this House.


Hear, hear!


The Solicitor General may be a fancy skater, but he has a responsibility to this House. If he is not able to inform the House, perhaps the Acting Prime Minister could, because he is all we have to deal with today. What was the mandate given to the security and intelligence services of the government by the cabinet committee on security and intelligence from 1970 on, which would have led senior officers to believe illegal activities would be justified if not publicly acceptable?


Mr. Speaker, there was no mandate given to the security service at any time indicating that illegal activities were justifiable in any way. The point has been made time and time again that all their activities had to be carried out within the framework of the law. There are a lot of people on the other side who are willing to judge and would apparently like to be appointed to the bench; but the judgment they are showing in this House certainly is not to their credibility.


Hear, hear!


You are the one who reported it.


Mr. Speaker, my final supplementary is for the Acting Prime Minister. Perhaps he will be able to clarify this situation. With respect to the secret million dollar computer located in the basement of the East Block, which serves the Privy Council and the Prime Minister's office, can the Acting Prime Minister indicate whether
November 1, 1977	COMMONS
any security or intelligence information, gathered either legally or illegally, has been fed into this computer? If so, who has had access to it, and has the information that has been gathered illegally now been disposed of?


Mr. Speaker, this computer which is now at the Privy Council is for the exclusive use of the Privy Council and the federal-provincial relations committee. It stores any information related to the activities of that office as in any other department. However, it does not collect information about national security.


Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Acting Prime Minister and it is designed to seek clarification of that remarkable four-year period between the Parti Quebecois break-in and the time when the Solicitor General, the Prime Minister and other ministers were made aware of the illegal act. Is it the policy of the government to allow the director general of the security services, General Dare, to proceed with surveillance activities, including illegal operations against political parties, labour unions, farm groups and individuals, without prior reference to and approval from General Dare's superior, the Solicitor General?


Mr. Speaker, the government has never authorized any official to commit illegal acts in Canada. General Dare received new directives from the government a few years ago and this entire organization now works according to directives issued by the government in 1975, I believe.


Mr. Speaker, evidently there was no answer. I have a supplementary question for the Solicitor General. In view of the answer of the Acting Prime Minister-


You have already indicated that there was no answer. Make up your mind.


In view of the answer of the Acting Prime Minister, would the Solicitor General be willing to table in this House the guidelines which are now in place, together with those which were in effect prior to January 9, 1973, to ensure that the director general of the security services does not make what the Prime Minister prefers to call "technical" breaches of the law in his attempt to apprehend real criminals and not

at the same time deny the obvious rights of private citizens of Canada?


Mr. Speaker, as far as the present mandate is concerned, the hon. member can refer to the speech I made in the House on Friday. I described and quoted from that mandate in detail. It is included in my speech.


Selective discussion.


Hon. members opposite have honed in on one possible offence against the Parti Quebecois, which is included in my speech, but perhaps in that process they are referring to a number of policy directives which were included in my speech. I ask the hon. member to refresh his memory.


He is evading the question once again.


You cannot read either.


Mr. Speaker, I would like to direct a question to the Minister of Transport.
Could the minister tell the House what is the present situation in the negotiations with the province of Quebec about a lane to be used only by buses on the Champlain bridge between Montreal and the south shore?


Mr. Speaker, I think that the National Harbours Board will give its approval tomorrow to the agreement with the government of the province of Quebec. We are awaiting approval from the province of Quebec.


Mr. Speaker, I should like to address my question to the Solicitor General as well. Today the minister said that there was a delay in informing the attorney general of Quebec about allegations of criminal actions pending a royal commission. I ask him whether the fact clearly is that the administration of justice, primarily, generally and certainly in this case, is the responsibility of the provinces? Why should the provincial administration of justice be delayed pending an inquiry that may take months, even years? I ask this question in light of the fact that thousands of other people, probably even tens of thousands, have answered in the courts charges of theft, arson and of breaking and

entering. Why is special treatment given to these particular people?


It is not a question of particular treatment given to anyone. The question is really one of developing evidence in examining complaints that have come in. What the hon. member is suggesting is that every time a complaint comes in concerning the operations or practices of the force, I should send the complaint to the provincial attorney general. The fact of the matter is that we have set up a royal commission inquiry which will examine the complaints to obtain factual evidence as to whether or not these complaints are substantiated.


To see whether you can cover up.


I really do not see how, by referring the complaint to a royal commission of inquiry, which is chaired by a judge of the Supreme Court of Alberta, I can be accused of covering up.


Because Quebec had the information, that is why.


I would hope that the royal commission of inquiry will examine, as a priority matter, all the complaints, which may include allegations of illegal activities. If in the course of the examination of these complaints they come up with hard evidence that there has been a commission of an illegality, I assume that the royal commission of inquiry will advise me of the evidence they have come up with and will recommend that that evidence be brought to the attention of the relevant attorney general of the province. I really do not see why, if that is the attitude of the members of the NDP, they were pressing to such an extent to have the royal commission of inquiry. What they are saying is that they want a royal commission of inquiry but they do not want it to do anything.


Hear, hear!


Mr. Speaker, I would again like to ask the Solicitor General whether he is now claiming there is any doubt whatever that there was an illegal break in? Did it take months for the royal commission to discover that fact?


I hope, Mr. Speaker, that it can be handled quite expeditiously by the royal commission-


Oh, oh!


-along with the other complaints that have been made. Once again, Mr. Speaker, the proof is in the pudding. We have referred all these complaints to the attention of the royal commission of inquiry and we expect them to examine them in an impartial light and to come to relevant conclusions.


Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Greenwood is aware, as we all are in the House except for the Solicitor General, that the terms of reference of the McDonald Commission are not adequate to do the job for which it was set up. In view of the growing tensions that are becoming so obvious between federal justice authorities and provinces, particularly the provinces of Quebec and Alberta, does the Solicitor General have plans to meet with his provincial counterparts as soon as possible in order to come to some interim working relationship until such time as the various commissions of inquiry are able to complete their work, which may take some months, and in order to facilitate the position of the police who are being caught in the middle of this important situation?


I met the attorneys general of all provinces, along with the Attorney General of Canada, during the month of June. I believe the situation as described by the hon. member is not quite exact.
While I am on my feet, Mr. Speaker, I would like to draw the attention of the hon. member to a point of misinformation which was contained in his speech last night when he once again, in an ominous fashion, tried to indicate that there was some plot between the government and the House and the fact-


Order.


Order, please.


Mr. Speaker, if I have given, advertently or inadvertently, misinformation in the House, certainly my record in the House is far below that of the Solicitor General.


Hear, hear!


The record is available for all to see. I want to ask the Solicitor General, in order to facilitate and co-ordinate proper and amiable relationships between various police forces in this country, what new initiatives does the Solicitor General have in mind following, or in addition to, the meetings held from time to time of the criminal intelligence service of Canada? Does he have any new initiatives to meet what is obviously an urgent situation?


I say that in spite of the misinformation, the hon. member does not have the courage to stand up and ask the question which would permit us to clear it up. There are a number of initiatives that have been taken by the government in connection with the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police in order to ensure greater co-ordination among the police forces of this country. So far as
November 1, 1977

attorneys general are concerned, I indicated, along with my colleague, the Minister of Justice, during my conference with the attorneys general last June, that we are ready to explore methods and means to have greater co-operation among all attorneys general because we think it is extremely important in the fight against crime in this country which is a matter of interest to all Canadian citizens.


PURPOSE OF OBTAINING LISTS OF PARTI QUEbECOIS MEMBERS-POSSIBILITY INFORMATION GIVEN TO POLITICAL GROUPS
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Acting Prime Minister and it is a follow-up of the general import of the question from my colleague, the hon. member for Egmont. It relates to the exchange of information. Certainly the raid or the break-in, whatever the Solicitor General wants to call it, of the two premises, that is the APLQ premises and the printing plant utilized by the PQ in the province of Quebec, had for its purpose, even though there was not a scintilla of evidence of any crime having been committed, to obtain lists, in one case a subscription list and in the other case a membership list. My question to the chief lieutenant of the Prime Minister in the province of Quebec, the temporary head of the government here today, the Acting Prime Minister, is this: The Minister of State for Urban Affairs in the House late last spring indicated that as the chief political organizer for the Liberal party in Quebec he had in his possession a list of all known separatist sympathizers in the province of Quebec. Is there any connection between these lists that the security services were after and the list now in the possession of one of the ministers from the province of Quebec? What was the purpose in getting those lists as far as the security service was concerned?


The answer is no.


Oh, oh!


Why?


Answer it.


Mr. Speaker, I gave a clear answer, Mr. Speaker. It is no.


Hear, hear!


When my colleague, the Minister of State for Urban Affairs, referred to a list of people who belong to the Parti Quebecois, let me say that I know a lot of them in my riding and anyway 1 am not worried about the next election.


Why don't you worry about the country?
Oral Questions


I am glad the Acting Prime Minister can be that definite and that blunt in his answer. Perhaps today he will not be able to give me that assurance, but I wonder if he would make a very thorough check so that he could assure the House and the public tomorrow that no information gathered by the security services of the RCMP or any other security service of this government has in any way been passed through, passed over or given to any other political groups in this country as distinct from governmental groups either at the provincial or the federal level.


If I can make myself clearer, 1 will reply in French. La reponse est non.


Oh, oh!


Mr. Speaker, I want an assurance


Sit down.


Order, please.


Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Solicitor General. When the MacKenzie report was tabled in the House in 1969, I made a statement with, I think, the full approval of the House, that it would be completely unacceptable for the House to have the security operations of this country put beyond the knowledge of the Prime Minister or the responsible minister of the government. Is it the position of the Solicitor General and of the government of this country today that the scope, not to mention the methods, of some of the security operations conducted in this country in the intervening years were beyond the knowledge of the supposedly responsible minister and the Prime Minister?


Mr. Speaker, as far as I am concerned it is quite clear that during the course of my experience as Solicitor General the RCMP security service was already operating under a very clear mandate which was given to it by the government in 1975. It was also made very clear to the security service and the commissioner of the force that all operations of the security service were to be carried out in full compliance with the law. The law, of course, has been amended since the period in question, and a number of new safeguards which I enumerated last night-eight or nine of them-have been introduced by the government to ensure greater accountability and greater control of the security service of this country.


1 wish the Solicitor General or the acting Prime Minister would give me a simple answer to a very simple question. I did not ask the Solicitor General whether security operations have been conducted within the law. I asked him whether it was the position of the government that the scope of the operations-for example, surveillance of the

Parti Quebecois and others-was beyond the knowledge of the responsible minister and the Prime Minister. That is the question I asked, and I would like a simple answer.


Yes or no to that.


Mr. Speaker, 1 can answer from my own experience as Solicitor General for the past year that I have had weekly meetings with the head of the security service.


That is not the question.


I am kept fully apprised of the scope of the surveillance which is done by the RCMP in our country at the moment.
KNOWLEDGE OF PRIME MINISTER OF SCOPE OF SURVEILLANCE OF PARTI QUfiBfiCOIS


Mr. Speaker, perhaps I can get an answer from the Acting Prime Minister to that very simple question. When the Prime Minister speaks as he has about surveillance of the Parti Quebecois by security operations in this country, is it the position of the Prime Minister that the scope of these operations was beyond the ken or knowledge of himself and the responsible minister, despite the emphasis we placed on the importance of this when the McKenzie report was tabled in the House back in 1969?


Mr. Speaker, I cannot answer on behalf of the Prime Minister on this specific case. According to what I know in the case, as soon as the Prime Minister knew that there was an
