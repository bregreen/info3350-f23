    "## Feature selection\n",
    "\n",
    "We've spoken before about **overfitting**. A model that is overfit has learned features of the training data that are unlikely to generalize to new, unseen data. As a rule of thumb, a model is very likely to be overfit if it uses on the order of as many features as the training data contains examples. The signature of an overfit model is good performance when evaluated against the training data, but poor performance when evaluated against held-out test data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Dimension reduction is one approach to addressing overfitting. Another is **feature selection**. When we select features to retain in our model, we're looking for ones that seem likely to provide useful information about the relationship between our objects and the class labels we seek to assign. Two useful approaches to feature selection are **ANOVA f-statistics** and **mutual information**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### *F*-statistic and ANOVA analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "We won't say much more about ANOVA analysis; you should have seen it in your stats class. It's conceptually similar to a *t*-test, in that it compares the difference in the means of two groups relative to the variance within each group. A large *F*-statistic means that two samples are significantly different. In our case, we're comparing the distribution of values within each feature to the distribution of true labels in the training data. Intuitively, a feature may be a good predictor of the class label if its distribution is similar to the distribution of the label, hence if the F-statistic between them is small. (But note that scikit-learn's `f_classif` method returns the inverse of the *F*-statistic, such that a large result indicates a likely *useful* feature.)\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem with the *F*-statistic is that it only captures linear, normally distributed relationships. The advantages are (1) that this assumption is often valid and (2), it's super easy to calculate, so is fast when run on large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mutual information\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mutual information** (MI) is abstractly similar to correlation or covariance -- it's a measure of how much two variables change together. But MI doesn't assume a linear relationship between the variables and it's suitable for categorical data, so is often preferred for our purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want the math, in the case of categorical data (like we're using here with word counts and class labels), mutual information is calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$MI(U,V)=\\sum_{i=1}^{|U|} \\sum_{j=1}^{|V|}\\frac{|U_i\\cap V_j|}{N}\\log\\frac{N|U_i \\cap V_j|}{|U_i||V_j|}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $\\cap$ indicates the **insection** of two sets. $N$ is the total number of observations in each vector. $i$ and $j$ represent the possible values in each vector. And $|U_i|$ is the count of instances of value $i$ in vector $U$.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we have two vectors, $U = [1,0]$ and $V = [1,0]$, we know that our MI score should be high, since $U$ is identical to $V$. For an *n*-class problem, the maximum unnormalized MI is log(*n*). In our example, $N$ = 2 (two observations per vector) and $i$ and $j$ are both drawn from `[1,0]` (or `[0,1]`, it doesn't matter). Hence:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$MI(U,V) = \\frac{1}{2}\\log\\frac{2(1)}{1(1)} + 0 + 0 + \\frac{1}{2}\\log\\frac{2(1)}{1(1)} = 0.693147$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The zeros correspond in this example to misaligned labels, of which there are none, hence $|U_i\\cap V_j| = 0$ for all $i\\neq j$ (again, in this specific example of perfect label alignment, not in all cases).\n",
    "\n",
    "Or consider the slightly more interesting case where $U = [1,1,2]$ and $V = [1,2,2]$. In this case, we calculate:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$MI(U,V) = \\frac{1}{3}\\log\\frac{3(1)}{2(1)} + \\frac{1}{3}\\log\\frac{3(1)}{2(2)} + 0 + \\frac{1}{3}\\log\\frac{3(1)}{1(2)} = 0.174416$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Mutual information is often (but not always) reported on a *normalized* basis, in which the raw MI value is divided by log($N$) (or, technically, by the mean entropy of the two variables, but it amounts to the same thing when there are the same number of classes in each variable), the maximum possible MI value for the case. The normalized MI for the first example is 0.693147/log(2) = 1.0. In the second example, normalized MI = 0.174416/log(3) = 0.15876.\n",
    "\n",
    "See the [sklearn documentation for `mutual_info_classif`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_selection.mutual_info_classif.html) for more information."
