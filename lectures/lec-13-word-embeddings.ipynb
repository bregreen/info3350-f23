    "## Words as vectors\n",
    "\n",
    "**Big picture: static word embeddings replace each word in our corpus with a vector** (typically of dimensionality between 100 and 1,000) **that captures the range of meanings of that word. We can use these vectors in place of token counts as the input features for any downstream NLP or text analysis task.**\n",
    "\n",
    "* We've previously represented **documents** as vectors\n",
    "    * Usually, vectors of word counts\n",
    "    * Or, with topic models, as vectors of topics\n",
    "* Limits of words, often discussed\n",
    "    * In brief: some words are more alike than others, but word counts don't reflect this fact\n",
    "    * Topic models helped to address this problem\n",
    "    * Today, a different approach: **word embeddings**\n",
    "* We might like to have a vector for each **word**, which we could in turn use to build our document vectors\n",
    "    * This will be an *unsupervised* task. We want to produce vectors that place similar words close together in vector space, but we don't want to use human-labled data to do so. We want instead to observe patterns of use in a large corpus.\n",
    "* One approach (not pursued here): Truncated SVD on sliding windows over words\n",
    "    * Group all the resulting bags of words by their 'center' word\n",
    "    * Reduce resulting \"doc\"-term matrix for each word via truncated SVD\n",
    "        * Like latent semantic analysis, but oriented around words rather than documents\n",
    "    * Relatively fast to train and decent performance\n",
    "    * Limited by linear relationships and lack of semantic connections\n",
    "* Language models\n",
    "    * Large neural language models achieve state-of-the-art performance on many (all?) NLP tasks\n",
    "    * These models generally seek to predict a word (or other element of a text sequence) on the basis of the words around it\n",
    "    * General architecture is:\n",
    "        * Embedding layer. Counts of words transformed into contextual vectors. Initially, weights are random. In the case of word embeddings, we want to learn the proper weights as our output objective.\n",
    "        * Intermediate (hidden) layer. Neural layers that can learn non-linear relationships between words and embeddings.\n",
    "        * Output layer. Optimize an objective function (for example, highest probability of next word, given an input sequence).\n",
    "    * `word2vec` (2013) showed that we can do without the intermediate layer if we just want to produce word embeddings\n",
    "        * This simplifies the computation, so we can use *much* more input text\n",
    "* CBOW vs. skip-gram\n",
    "    * `word2vec` can use two different models: Continuous bag of words (CBOW) and skip-gram\n",
    "    * CBOW is more \"traditional.\" Objective is to predict a word given the *n* words before and after it.\n",
    "    * Skip-gram \"flips\" the prediction task. Try to predict the *n* contextual words, given a seed word.\n",
    "    * CBOW is faster to train and better captures *syntax* (plurals are closer to other plurals in vector space)\n",
    "    * Skip-gram is slower to train and better captures *semantic* relationships ('king' moves  closer to 'prince' than to 'kings')\n",
    "* Training is slow either way, so using pretrained embeddings is standard practice, but ...\n",
    "    * Embedded relationships and biases of training set\n",
    "    * Change over time\n",
    "    * Polysemy remains within the embedding\n",
    "        * \"Class\" vector has components of education and of social status, for example"
