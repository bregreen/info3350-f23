In contrast, the **zero-shot** paradigm leaves model weights untouched. This makes it much faster than fine-tuning, though zero-shot accuracy is sometimes lower.\n",

        "In the zero-shot paradigm, the main idea is to construct an input to the model and then compare which label is most likely, all without changing model parameters. And since there's no training (i.e. changing model parameters), there's no train/test split. All data is treated as evaluation data here.\n",

We need to add additional text to the beginning and/or end of an example because the model's parameters are not being changed.

Among these were Lucan, a famous poet, and Seneca, a philosopher and Nero's tutor when he was young. This novel is a collection of communications mostly between Tigellinus, the head of the Praetorian Guard and Paenus, a tribune of the Secret Police. Also included are intercepted letters between Seneca and Lucan, who was Seneca's nephew. Quite a few of the \"conspirators\" were executed or forced to commit suicide, and others were exiled. I really like epistolary novels, and this was a good one. Although I do wonder that Tigellinus and Paenus would spend so much time writing to each other; you'd think most of their communications would have been face-to-face.\n",
