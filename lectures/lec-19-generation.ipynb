        "\n",
        "In lecture 16, we saw how to **fine-tune** an existing pretrained language model by changing its weights in response to a new task. In contrast, the **zero-shot** paradigm leaves model weights untouched. This makes it much faster than fine-tuning, though zero-shot accuracy is sometimes lower.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the zero-shot paradigm, the main idea is to construct an input to the model and then compare which label is most likely, all without changing model parameters. And since there's no training (i.e. changing model parameters), there's no train/test split. All data is treated as evaluation data here.\n",

        "\n",
        "With zero-shot learning, we can't just feed examples into an LM the way we could with fine-tuning. We need to add additional text to the beginning and/or end of an example because the model's parameters are not being changed. The **prompt** (also called a **template**) is all the extra text that we add around an example in order to get a useful output from an LLM. We'll see several different prompts and prompting strategies below.\n",

Rather he was educated, well-read, and deeply thoughtful about the mechanics of the English language as shown with this short treatise. Reading it I started thinking about how people are remembered after they die in comparison to what they thought of themselves. Issac Newton thought himself a theologian and only messed about with physics when bored, Lovecraft wrote horror to pay the bills, but we only remember physics and Cthulhu. I know how I feel about myself, but after reading this it makes me wonder if I'll be remembered that way or even if anyone feels the same way about myself as I do even now. P.S.
